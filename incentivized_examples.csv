13," full disclosure i received this product free from amazon simplereview in order to provide a review here. i have attempted to be objective in reviewing it. this is a twopack of simple sterling .925 fine silver chain necklaces, one 18, one 24, otherwise identical. they are articulated snake chain style  a chain of round segments closely interlocked to form a thin round cylinder with a slightly textured surface, that bends and curves smoothly. they attach with a springloaded clasp.the chains are very thin. the quality seems good. the surface appearance is smooth, shimmery, and very attractive. they are perfect as subtle accent jewelry or for casual wear. they are too thin to make a bold statement, but very pretty for what they are. you can give them as a gift with confidence.",full disclosure i received this product free from amazon simplereview in order to provide a review here.
651,"... something frosted, something blue. i apologize for the rhyme but this is a new take on an older model which i own and lovetotallee slim skin iphone 5  5s snap on hard shell case comfort grip black. the balance between minimalism and protection are still incorporated into the design, but the back is frosted and the color scheme is blue. to extend my trite opening, this 2014 model is a marriage of good design and aesthetics.i was provided with a review sample by the manufacturer, in part i am sure, because of how much i loved the older model. since most folks are probably not familiar with the older design that this one shares ill rehash the key pointsprotection the rigid case is strong enough to protect against hard surfaces and objects, but is also pliable and capable of absorbing or at least mitigating shocks from short distance drops. in addition the top part of the face is raised above the phones screen.  if you drop your phone on a flat, hard surface the raised lip of the case will provide some protection for your screen. of course,  all bets are off if you drop it on an uneven surface like gravel or rocks. this is a case that is more at home indoors than one whose owner participates nin rigorous activities.construction pliable, shock absorbing material surrounding your phone, with a hard and still slightly cushioned back.function everything fits as though this was an integral part of the phone itself. this is especially true of the camera and flash. if you previously owned an iphone 4 you will especially appreciate the improved camera performance of the 5 or 5s in this case. plus you can use your screen up to the very edge, something other cases do not allow.here is what this one has that trumps the older model aesthetics. the color is certainly not boring. its vivid in fact. and the frosted back still allows the apple logo to show, but the frosting adds texture and depth.the bottom line, though, is this case provides more protection than you would guess at a glance, and is more than just a pretty face at the altar.",provided with a review

975,".product provided free of charge for writing a review.this is a media player that will stream video from popular places like netflix, youtube, and other videos in the google store.  it is an android device for the google ecosystem.i tested this particular product using netflix at 1080p and the results were less than desirable.  initially the video was blurry.  after about 1 minute, the video got clearer but was not smooth playing.  i reduced the video play back quality 540 in resolution???, the video was no longer choppy, but the video quality at that low of a resolution was not that great  so there is the trade off.next i tried this product out with youtube.  i had no issue with youtube playing  its quality was good.  but to get around youtube you would probably be better off with a bluetooth keyboard as opposed to using the provided remote.the two test above were done via the supplied hdmi cable.i did not try this device with the videos in the google store as i do not purchase from the google ecosystem. also, i did not try this with skype.beware  this is an android device for the google ecosystem. you cannot play amazon instant videos using this product  you need the amazon firetv to play instant videos from amazon.so which should you buy? it depends. if you spend most of your time with the google ecosystem then this box might work for you. if you spend most of your time with the amazon ecosystem then the firetv is the box for you.  netflix video playback on the firetv is seamless.my preference for a google device iskeedox 8g version dual core android 4.2 smart tv box xbmc media player 1080p wifi hdmi xbmc netflix youtube skype qq, as i think it works a little better than this device, and it is selling for 66 with prime shipping instead of selling for over 100, but that is just my opinion.normally i would give a device like this 3 stars, but i must realize that there are people out there who are heavy into the google ecosystem, and just because i am not one of them does not mean there is a problem with the box.just remember the limitations on using netflix with this box.",product provided free of charge for writing a review.

782,"a bit on the larger side, and with a capacity of 10,400mah 10.4a, the eachine xpower x1 external battery is probably best suited for those with devices that consume higher levels of power, like certain smart phones, tablets like the ipad, and ebook readers like the kindle fire.when the power is turned on, a blue led indicates the percentage of charge available.  there are two usb output ports, one rated at 1a, and a second at 2.1a for higher output devices.  an led that serves as a flashlight, is becoming almost a standard item on power banks, and the x1 has one as well.  when recharging another device, the lcd indicates whether the output is 1.0a or 2.1a, and there is circuitry in the x1 that turns the power off to prevent overcharging.to achieve the higher capacity, much of the unit is devoted to batteries, which makes it larger and heavier than most battery banks.  recharge time is stated as 10 hours, and that8217s a little optimistic, as even with an input of 2 amps, it can take longer than 12 hour, to recharge from 30 or less, back up to 100.  if you are headed off on a trip lasting several days, be sure to allow enough time to fully recharge the unit.  the lcd should also help to insure that you don8217t run short of recharging power.i was provided a sample for evaluation, and if high capacity is a primary concern, the x1, or theeachine xpower x2, which is very similar, could be an a solid choice, as long as you are prepared for the larger size, and weight, as these units are not the most convenient to carry.  no pouch is provided, but a cord with accessory connectors is included.  the cost is on the higher side, so you would want to be very sure that you require this much power before you buy.","i was provided a sample for evaluation, and if high capacity is a primary concern, the x1, or theeachine xpower x2, which is very similar, could be an a solid choice, as long as you are prepared for the larger size, and weight, as these units are not the most convenient to carry."

998,"a fast little cardreader with a storage compartment and a captive cable.good fit for my sdhc cards. i like how the card sticks out no springloading. i have some mediacard hubs like in my dell monitors where the card has to be inserted deeply into the slot, and if the spring loaded eject mechanism doesnt work, you need pliers to pull the card out not fun.i really like the short captive cable and ability to store one card of each kind inside the lid a nice place to keep spares. and that the unit is powered by the usb bus, no additional power cable needed. theres a small blue led signaling both power and activity.i tried the reader out so far on windows 7 usb3, macos usb3 and freebsd usb2 using a transcend 16gb sdhc. on both freebsd and win7, i got steady 14.5mbs write speeds likely bound by the card, rather than the reader. macos on a 2013 macbook pro was mysteriously much slower, but i didnt have a chance to diagnose why. a sample was provided to me for review. this sort of cardreader is useful to anybody with multiple portable gadgets sooner or later youll need to get data off a device thats broken, or when the battery is dead, or want to do a 32gb transfer and not wait for usb2 on your device, or maybe the cable is missing, or you need to zero out the memory card before giving it away... for all of those scenarios, a card reader like this one is very useful. recommended.",provided to me for review.
67,"a few weeks ago i was thinking to myself that it would be really nice if there was a way to attach a cord to my iphone case!  i am very pleased that someone else thought of this as well.i like that the necklace is long, and adjustable, so you can change it to any length you like.  i had trouble at first connecting it securely to my iphone 4, but once i figured out the feel of it, i can do it easily and its very secure.  its nice to have my phone handy when i am working at my desk because it often gets buried in my paperwork.  its also handy to use when im taking walks outside.  i also like that i didnt have to remove my phone case to attach this.  the stylus is a nice idea too but i personally dont use a stylus often.the only negative i can say about it is using while reaching down to the ground.  when i have to bend over a lot, such as picking up my daughter or cleaning up the house, doing yardwork, etc, the phone bangs into things and i need to be very careful so i dont break it.  however if i wear a jacket or sweatshirt i can always tuck it into the jacket when bending over, which helps.  i dont think it would work well for jogging or running though, it would bounce around too much.another reason i love this is because i have a lot of photos and videos of my young daughter on my iphone.  after i take a video she likes to watch 34her34 videos and look at her pictures ive taken.  and she always wants to hold the phone while she views them.  with the ihangy, i can hold on to the cord while she holds the phone to keep her from accidentally dropping it.for me, this product fills a need i have and i am very happy with it.  i would recommend it for others who are looking for something like this.  i was provided a sample for review purposes.",i was provided a sample for review purposes.

843,"a note  i did receive a free cable for this.with that said  this cable is really quite good.  takes a beating as well.  ive had it for about a month  which, in that time, i mainly used it for my xbox 360 to the tv.  games look crisp and clear  though there wasnt much of a difference between this specific cable and any other.  thanks to amazon finally bringing prime movies to the 360, i was able to watch a couple streaming hd movies on my tv, and they looked quite good as well.  here i noticed a bigger difference between clarity, though i cant really explain why.  but this cable showed movies better.this hdmi cable is also apparently compatible with the newest 1.4b standard  i cant really speak to that, as not many devices are out yet that take advantage of the new standard mainly that you can now route ethernet aka internet traffic through hdmi.  a friend has one of those hdmi cable testers, and it did show its ability to do ethernet, so youll be set for the near future when devices do take advantage of that.what really impressed me, though  was that i tend to take my xbox to a friends house, where there are 3 kids  ages 11 to 3.  they like playing kinect sports and such, and so my hardware tends to take a pounding just because  well, thats how kids are.  especially with the younger ones, the ripping of cables from the tv and stepping on the wires can be really hard on electronics, and i actually lost 2 hdmi cables just from the roughness.  so having this cable still work like a champ after intense pulls and stomps speaks well of its construction.  major props for this.especially for the price, even when it does die out, getting a new one wont cost an arm and a leg.all in all  this cable is well worth the price, especially after how i saw it hold up after when kids attack movie was over.  multiple times.",a note  i did receive a free cable for this.

473,"after buying many different cases, i received this case through the utry review program about four days ago and i seriously regret ever having bought other cases. initial impressions were that the case is extremely sturdy in comparison to my incipio off grid pro and mophie juicepack air. it is not nearly as sturdy as my otterbox cases or my lifeproof case but those cases do not charge the phone as well as protect them. it is much sturdier than my incipio offgrid pro which did not last long6 weeks before the bumpers chipped and snapped off. the charging mat is also far superior to the mophie usb plug which broke after less than a month of moderate use. comparisons aside, this case is better than either of the other battery cases i have purchased and i am now feeling buyers remorse for not buying unu cases in the first place. here is a brief runup of my sentiments however, if any new impressions or events occur, i will update the review accordinglyif it combusts, ill update the review.prosvery solid bumper design. my phone feels much better protected than the incipio off grid pro and equally protected as the mophie juicepack.the battery indicator, power button and capacity are as good as can be. i leave work after 1215 hour days with my phone topped off with bluetoothwifilocationfetch left on.visually pleasing and the case compliments my white iphone 5s well.it is as simple as picking up or putting down your phone to use it. i dont have to worry about the usb connector breaking from regular use like the mophie case did.usb chargeable when you dont have a mat.consthe charging mat has a small indicator light which is on the back of the case. initially, i couldnt tell that it was charging but this fear goes away so long as your settings dictate that your phone will vibrate or ring when it is receiving power.the white case is very glossy and can slip from your hands easily. however, the gloss looks incredible and should hold up better than most matte coated cases would.the power button is hard to press with the case on. maybe with some 34breaking in34 this will go away. it doesnt help that the phone has a minuscule amount of vertical movement space where it can be better suited to sit flush against the exterior power button.this case is yet another that requires an included headphone extender to function with largecurved plugs. it is strange that manufacturers leave this space so narrow. in comparison, the cavity for the headphones is larger than other cases i have used before.does not include a wall plug however i have accumulated entirely too many to feel disappointed. this should be a consideration if the case is being bought as a gift for someone who wouldnt have a usb outlet.overall, i wish i had bought this case before any of the other battery cases considering the capacity, sturdiness and unique charging abilities of this case. im now having difficulty choosing between this and my otterbox commuter wallet because of how many compliments i have received.",received this case through the utry review 
188,"after reading the other reviews i was surprised as for me, this unit works fine on the devices that tried thus far. so i was able to get my tablet and other three devices to charge overnight and all charged to 100 percent. note that i used high quality samsung usb cable that is the original cable that came with my devices. also i plugged in the tablet in the top port. so for me, this unit worked well and i am very pleased with it. for me, i plan to use this for traveling purposes as i can charge 4 devices at the same time.listed below are the devices i tested1 in top port tab 2 10.1 tablet charged very welland i used samsung usb cable to use for charging. keep in mind that i had three other devices plugged in as well. the amperage needed for the tab 2 is 1.5 amp so this charger did a superb job and charged it to 100 percent.2 samsung grand phone  this requires about one amp. it charged right along with my other devices just fine.3 samsung player 5.0  this device charged very well. this unit i selected to test because it is very finicky where charging is concerned and usually will only charge on a real samsung charger! but it charged to 100 percent on this unit with no problems.4 samsung player 4.2  same thing here this device charged very well. this unit i selected to test because it is very finicky where charging is concerned and usually will only charge on a real samsung charger! but it charged to 100 percent on this unit with no problems.one more thing i will say from my own experience about usb charging cables all are not made equal. in the past, i tried a cheap cable no name brand and the cable was thin and cheap looking. then i plugged it into my samsung charger and the device refused to charge at all. simply would not begin the charge! when i unplugged that cable and inserted the samsung cable or tried a higher end cable, the charge began. so be sure to use a high quality cable on this device.note that i received this unit for testing purposes and i did just that. and i am happy to report that i am happy with this product. this is an honest review that reflects what i discovered with this unit.",note that i received this unit for testing purposes
692,"after receiving the packaging for this battery pack, i was surprised at how small and lightweight the battery pack is. i opened up the packaging surprised to find a 100 charged battery pack immediately ready to use, this was convenient to not have to immediately charge after receiving. for the past week i have been using the battery pack fairly often. i can typically get 2 full charges on my iphone 5 while still using the phone. charging the battery pack back up takes a few hours, so i suggest charging at night. the unit itself has a couple neat features. first, the unit charges by a microusb to usb cord included just plug it in to your usb adapter or your computer and charging begins. the output of the battery pack is a single usb plug, simply insert your device cable and charging your device starts right up. this battery pack did not include any cables other than the usb to microusb. the display will show to the 1 unit how much power is left in the battery no more guessing what two out of four lit dots means. the unit will also automatically choose the output best for your mobile device if your device can only accept 1.0 amp of power, the unit will charge at 1.0 amp, otherwise the unit will quick charge at 2.1 amps. the last main feature is a flashlight. this flashlight isnt very bright, but in a pitch black situation where you need it, it would be useful. overall this is a great little unit that will get you two charges on your mobile phone. it is great for people on the go as well as anyone that cannot get to an outlet before running out of power on their mobile devices internal battery.this product was received as a free testing sample and i was not required to write a positive review.",this product was received as a free testing sample and i was not required to write a positive review.

541,"after using a couple of those battery phone cases and the small rechargeable batteries, i came upon the opportunity to try this 15000 mah battery received it as a free sample for review from maxboost. i have to say im very pleased with it overall. first, an iphone 5s has a 1900mah battery, so this battery can and will charge your phone again and again without needing to be recharged itself. this is fantastic if you are on the go all the time, dont have an outlet, or need a charge during a power outage the built in flashlight is great for the last one, too!.  its pretty easy to use, theres only one button power and all the information you need to know is displayed on the screen, so its good for less tech savvy folks. i will say it takes a bit of time to charge the phone   took about 3 hours to go from 17 to 90. the battery itself also takes a loooong time to charge, the initial charge took over 20 hours, and about 12 hours from then on.  i wouldnt recommend charging anything that has a super dead battery  i attempted to charge my ipad, which i hadnt used in months, and it took over an hour to just have enough power to turn on.. charging it fully just about drained the battery. i have not tried to charge multiple devices at once, as this was not recommended by other reviewers. the battery is also pretty heavy, but i did expect that since it is a much larger capacity than anything ive dealt with thus far. its not too heavy for a purse, but it would probably be too bulky and heavy to stick in your pocket.the instruction manual claims that the battery comes with 4 tips lightning, 30 pin apple, micro usb, and mini usb  mine did not come with the lightning tip, but i contacted customer service and was promptly mailed a lightning cable  awesome customer service on their part!proshigh capacity, can recharge my phone and smaller devices many times overeasy to useshows exact battery percentage, and has confirmation of charging in and out on screencomes with multiple tips for charging various devicescharge holds well on standby without drainingawesome for on the go without worryingconstakes a long time to charge battery, must be prepared in advancetakes significantly longer to charge phone than using an outletdoesnt do well charging devices that have been dead for a while","after using a couple of those battery phone cases and the small rechargeable batteries, i came upon the opportunity to try this 15000 mah battery received it as a free sample for review from maxboost."
331,"after using this case for a couple of weeks, i am very impressed.this battery case comes in two pieces  the one that fits over the back, and then the front that snaps onto the back. that makes it easy to put on and take off.the charging mat works seamlessly  i never had a problem with the case not lining up correctly.the mat comes with a micro usb cord which can be used to keep the mat 34alive,34 but it also can be used to charge the battery and phone by plugging it directly into the battery. so there are two ways you can easily charge your battery  nice if you are on the road and dont have the pad.but here is the best part. the micro usb cord will also allow you to connect directly to your computer using the usb cord  no lightning cord required.the onoff and volume buttons are covered, but the external buttons line up perfectly and i had no problem with those. if you use earphones, you will need to use the included 34dongle34 to slip in and plug it in. while it is a bit unwieldy, just slipping the dongle onto the buds instead of the iphone allows you to easily use them when you want, and not have something hanging out the bottom when you dont.i am grateful to have been supplied a complimentary sample of this case so that i could test it for my review.edited after using this for even longer, i am impressed with how long the battery lasts even when i dont sit it on the charger when i come home. it is still the easiest and nicest addition to my cell phone i have.",i am grateful to have been supplied a complimentary sample of this case so that i could test it for my review.
834,"ah, cables!  theyre all the same.  right?  and, theyre all overpriced.  well, not this one.  when i set up my system, i went out and bought hdmi cables at the big box store.  i didnt buy the most expensive cables in the store.  but, the cost was still five times the price of this cable.  my dvr is attached to my television through an hdmi switch and i was having some issues with that switch handling the handshake between the tv and the dvr.  when i called the manufacturer of the switch thats when i found out that the big box stores have relatively low margins on their tvs but make it up in the margins on their cables.  i ordered a couple of much better cables from that manufacturer and was about to install them when the offer to review this cable came along.  i took the offer and received the cable for free.the first thing i noticed is the cable is much better built, both the connectors and the thickness of the cable than the previous cable i had paid five times as much for.  the replacement cable i had bought was a little nicer, having a braided cloth shield on it.  but, again, that cable, that i thought was inexpensive, was still double the price of this cable.  when i installed the infigear cable, i didnt expect to notice a difference in the picture quality. but, i think i actually did.  unfortunately, neither cable fixed the problem with the switch.if i hadnt had this experience, i would be hesitant to buy a cable at this price, figuring it must be junk.  dont make that mistake.  this is a great cable.  and, there is no reason to pay more.  i will never buy another cable from a big box store again.",  i took the offer and received the cable for free.
453,"although i received this from the company to field test, i must say i am sold on this iphone 5s case.  in a nutshell, it provides excellent protection against drops, is extremely convenient to use for charging your phone, and gives the iphone a great looking case that has a great feel to it.  i own the unu dx case which is essentially the same case as this one but with a few minor improvements. it doesnt have the wireless charging station.  i dropped my iphone in the dx case from about 5 feet  onto the cement road.  both the case and the phone were not damaged in any way, to my amazement.  i love being able to just set my iphone down on the charging station and not having to plug in a wire to recharge it.  charging is quick and convenient  and lights provide the status of the charge. i also appreciate the easy to use buttons on the unu aero case that operate the buttons on the iphone itself volumn up and down, top power button.  i dont know how unu does it,  but the battery enclosed in the case enables my iphone 5s to last several days before having to recharge it.  this case only adds a few ounces and makes the iphone a bit longer which i dont really notice at all. after seeing my unu case,  several friends and family members have purchased  them for their iphones. i am hoping that unu comes out with a similar wireless charging case and station for the apple ipad.","although i received this from the company to field test, i must say i am sold on this iphone 5s case"
253,"an unusually small battery pack with included usb cable provides a decent extra battery for one device, but lacks the ability to charge itself while charging another unit ie, charge while discharging.the 3100mah capacity gets me nearly half a charge in the big extendedlife battery i use on my galaxy nexus phone a 5900mah zerolemon battery, and should be plenty to charge the stock galaxy nexus battery 16501850mah depending on model.  similarly it should be enough to fullycharge most slimline phones, but only enough to topup larger devices like tablets.  i dont really have a way to measure charging speed  current, but for my 1a devices this pack seemed normally speedy, comparable to using a 1a usb wallcharger.theres no onoff switch or other controls, so its straightforward to use. like most small battery packs, this unit cant charge and discharge at once. so if the pack is charging itself, the attached load is not charging there are times when im on the go that id like to be able to topoff the battery pack while it charges a device, rather than waiting until im back to my base to fully charge everything.the distinctive colors are a nice touch mine is orange, making these units harder to accidentally leave behind.  the included removable flat usb cable matches the batterys color which doesnt really matter, but is a nice aesthetic touch.  the cable is long enough for the battery to sit on the desk while i hold the handset thats being charged in my hand or to my head.  thats a much better design than the short captive cables that require both battery and handset be held inhand.  the model i received has some text on the back, which apparently the production models do not.the unit looks like a miniature iphone.  the front of the battery pack is even a glossy imitation of a screen, which i had hoped would display the power usage, but is just a facade.  that glossy screen draws smudges just like a real screen, so id rather have had the front be colored like the rest of the unit.like most such battery packs, this one is made in china. and like other reviewers here, i was put off by the heavy americacentric branding, but my review is of the product, not of 5stars marketing.  the marketing could use some work. i was given this product to review. i received no other compensation, and my review is my honest opinion of the product. so while the capacity is modest, the black phone face is a smudge magnet, and id like to be able to charge the pack at the same time its discharging, the positives warranty, the color, and especially the small sizeweight, earn this battery a place in the camerabag i carry daily, and a fourstar rating.  recommended for a lightweight extra battery."," i received no other compensation, and my review is my honest opinion of the product."
853,"and i think that is a major plus.  ive looked at quite a few external chargers, but few match the size of my phone like this one does.  why is that important?  because i know that if my phone will fitin an evening bag, small purse, coat pocket, etc.then this charger should tuck in nicely, nestled right up against the phone.having looked at quite a few other chargers, i can say that most work basically the same.  your main decision you need to make is just how much mah you need for your particular situation.  this one, at 4000mah will fully charge your phone one time.  if you need power for standing 24 hours in line waiting for concert tickets or a black friday event, you need a much bigger power bank say 10,000 to 15,000mah.  if you are going camping out in the wilderness, you need an even bigger power bank maybe 15,000 to 20,000mah.  if you are the designated powerholder for the entire family on vacation you need a few big banks to keep up with demand.  at the opposite end, you can find tiny, simple chargers that will give you a burst of emergency power to call home for help.  those can be the size of a thick business card that fits in your wallet.so, if 4000mah is the power size youve decided on, you cant go wrong with this charger  it works well and efficiently.  it is also sharplooking with its brushed aluminum finish.  the aluminum finish is on the topside the bottom is a hard, but rubberyfeel plastic.  why the fourstar, and not a fivestar, rating?  while the design is decent, it is not outstanding.  there are some chargers available here on amazon that will wow you!  this is not one of them.  but if design is not important to you, this is a perfectly fine model.another plus is that the amount of charge remaining is showed quite clearly in five led light combinations.  most other chargers only give you four stages.  with this charger, the led lights start with a solid red light when it is under 25 charged, the progress through flashing red, flashing red and green, flashing green, then solid green when there is a 96100 charge.the silky black drawstring pouch is nicely made and will hold the charger, the mini or micro usb cables, and your phone, too if its in a minimalist case.i received a sample product from arctic.",i received a sample product from arctic.
19,"any product, even the simple items we dont have much reverence for, can be improved.  it is just rare that companies try.  dotdot has tried and succeeded with their travel bottles.  typical travel bottles and thin plastic with snap lids that can easily leak.  that is why we have to bury them in plastic bags within bags to avoid clothes covered in shampoo.these bottles are instead a combination of a silicone sleeve similar to silicone cookware and a leakproof cap.  the sleeve is solid and passes through the cap, creating a sort of oring seal that locks in even pure liquids.  because the silicone is flexible, it bulges rather than crushes under pressure.  they are bpa free, approved for carryon, and food safe, so baby food is an option.  for shower use, a suction cup is embedded, so no worries if there isnt sufficient shelf space.  the silicone sleeve can be removed for very easy cleaning.i am surprised by how much better these are than any other travel bottles ive used.  i recommend them.thank you to dotdot for a review sample.",thank you to dotdot for a review sample.

520,"as i8217ve mentioned before, i8217m not an electronics junkie like most men andor young men my age.  i think i8217m very adept with the products 8211 its uses and advantages 8211 but if you8217re showing up to this review hoping to ascertain some great discourse on power consumption, rates of use, and the like, then you8217re in for a disappointment.  on the other hand, if you want little more than the 8216straight skinny8217 on how well you8217d be served or not by having such a product in your collection of tools, then you might be pleased or even surprised.the good people at oxa contacted me directly, asking if i8217d be interested in giving their oxa 3000mah ultrathin external battery charger a try and 8211 in all honestly 8211 i rarely refuse trying products like this.  see, i live and work in arizona, where my wife and i are frequently on the go both for work as well as for pleasure.  the terrain being what it is in what i call 8216the other land down under,8217 arizona is never truly great for cell use 8211 not in ways the big cities are 8211 so i8217m constantly finding myself driving in and out of 8216cellular hell,8217 forcing my iphone to roam for a signal and consequently lose battery charge.  for that reason, i keep a variety of chargers on my person quite often, and i8217m only too happy to give another model a whirl.to my delight, oxa 3000mah ultrathin external battery charger performed wonderfully.  it charged up fairly quickly from my pc8217s usb port.  once i had need of a power boost, i simply pulled it from my pocket its thicker than a credit card but characteristically almost the same lengthwidth, attached the cable to my iphone 4, and 8211 i8217m not kidding 8211 it didn8217t take even ten minutes to get the phone back to full charge.  i8217ve been able to reuse the same battery without recharging it three times to do the same before i figured i8217d best let it reenergize back at home.also, one evening my wife was lying in bed with her amazon kindle when she realized she had left her power cord back at work.  knowing that i keep an ample supply of power in reserve for any emergency, she asked if i had anything to get a boost.  i handed her this battery, along with the cord packet and, again, the unit had absolutely no difficulty whatsoever in getting her kindle back to life and then some in power capacity.  that8217s impressive.what8217s great about oxa8217s design is that the main cord system works off a usb port, but then the cord8217s other end has a series of interchangeable connectors for practically any use one might have with today8217s electronics.  as you can tell by reading oxa8217s product descriptions, their devices are meant to offer a high degree of flexibility for consumers, eliminating your need to carry one external power supply for this device, one external battery for a different one, and so on and so forth with oxa, all you need is this battery and the cord kit which is included.  it comes in a small resealable that also fits nicely in your pocket.the oxa 3000mah ultrathin external battery charger portable power bank is produced by oxa, and it8217s featured prominently on their own website andor available for purchase at amazon.com.  while i thought the suggested retail price of 39.99 to be a bit high though not unreasonable by comparison to some other models i8217ve researched and reviewed in the past, its current going price of 16.99 is an absolute steal.  at that price, one could easily have a few in their possession, and i would suspect you8217d never find yourself without a source of power 8230 unless, of course, the zombie apocalypse finally destroys mankind.highly recommended.  if you8217re like me 8211 constantly on the go and without routine access to a pc or electrical source where you can plug in for a quick boost of power 8211 then it would be behoove you to have the oxa 3000mah ultrathin external battery charger in your pocket or at your fingertips.  it8217s thinner than my iphone so it fits nicely in my pocket and its ease of operations along with its reliability makes it a terrific alternative for my busy powerconsumption lifestyle.in the interests of fairness, i8217m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at oxa provided me with a free copy of the oxa 3000mah ultrathin external battery charger portable power bank by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review and their contribution in no way, shape or form influenced by opinion of it.",oxa provided me with a free copy

934,"as usual i received this product free in exchange for a free review.  also as usual i give my candid opinions below.firstly, the description of this product doesnt really do it justice so ill start out with an overview.  when i requested a sample of this thing i imagined it to be much smaller but this guy is almost 4 feet long.  on front and back it boasts 9 clearfront pockets, from 2x2 inches to about 4x2 inches. 8 opaquefront pockets, about 2x2 inches 3 larger opaquefront pockets, about 8x10 inches arranged concentrically 8 velcro tiedowns for cables and such 10 elastic slots for screwdrivers and the like or other hangersnow remember, multiply this all by 2 because its got all this on both sidesit comes with a metal hanger that sticks out the top so you can hang it in the closet or wherever you prefer.ok, now that weve dispensed with the description, qualitatively the unit seems pretty high quality.  the pockets are very tough and could stand some abuse, even the clear ones.  you could store a lot of randomness in this sucker im not sure i own enough stuff to fill this up.my only point of concern would be the metal hanger itself.  the body of this will take a lot of weight but the hanger seems somewhat suspect and if you had this thing fully loaded with anything heavy enough im not 100 sure that hanger would take the weight.  time will tell i suppose.in summary, the unit seems wonderfully designed for those who have enough stuff to actually fill it.  id keep an eye on the hook if it was heavily weighted but aside from that im impressed.",as usual i received this product free in exchange for a free review.
261,"as usual i received this product in exchange for an honest review. also as usual i give my candid opinions below despite that kindness.my first impression of this unit was that it was incredibly ugly and frankly rather offensive. the unit i received for review is an obnoxious yellow color with a logo and extensive writing printed directly on it asking for positive reviews online. its also clearly marked as made in china which is rather perturbing given its made by a company called 5 star america. i certainly have nothing against china but if youre going to wrap yourself in the flag then youre rather obligated to follow through with the patriotism indicated by your name.on the positive side the unit does seem to be relatively effective at its job and the usb cable included is a nice flat one which resists most of the issues usb cables have. the problem comes in when you compare this to the photos here on amazon. other reviews have indicated that these review versions are different from the ones you get if you actually make a purchase. the photos show a normal usb cable so im rather at a loss as to what to think. if i tried to buy this i just have no idea what i would end up getting.in summary, im not entirely sure what to think because i dont know what relationship the product i received has to the one pictured. if they really are completely different as indicated in some other posts then anything i say is somewhat moot. if the unit is as featured in the photos then thats got pluses and minuses. all that having been said, id be really cautious spending money with this company. they seek reviews using one product and hope to apply it to an apparently different product. this makes me wary and given the number of other choices out there its just not worth the risk.","as usual i received this product in exchange for an honest review. also as usual i give my candid opinions below despite that kindness.my first impression of this unit was that it was incredibly ugly and frankly rather offensive. the unit i received for review is an obnoxious yellow color with a logo and extensive writing printed directly on it asking for positive reviews online. its also clearly marked as made in china which is rather perturbing given its made by a company called 5 star america. i certainly have nothing against china but if youre going to wrap yourself in the flag then youre rather obligated to follow through with the patriotism indicated by your name.on the positive side the unit does seem to be relatively effective at its job and the usb cable included is a nice flat one which resists most of the issues usb cables have. the problem comes in when you compare this to the photos here on amazon. other reviews have indicated that these review versions are different from the ones you get if you actually make a purchase. the photos show a normal usb cable so im rather at a loss as to what to think. if i tried to buy this i just have no idea what i would end up getting.in summary, im not entirely sure what to think because i dont know what relationship the product i received has to the one pictured. if they really are completely different as indicated in some other posts then anything i say is somewhat moot. if the unit is as featured in the photos then thats got pluses and minuses. all that having been said, id be really cautious spending money with this company. they seek reviews using one product and hope to apply it to an apparently different product. this makes me wary and given the number of other choices out there its just not worth the risk."

947,"as usual i received this unit in exchange for a review. actually, i received two units in exchange for a review because i believed that the first one didnt work.when the first unit arrived i plugged it in to charge it as instructed using one of the manufacturers 6plug usb charging devices. at first the units lights flashed to indicate charging but when i returned several hours later it had to all appearances bricked itself.  in fact i was so convinced that it had shuffled off the mortal coil that i emailed the manufacturer to let them know and they insisted on sending another unit. it quickly arrived and promptly did the exact same thing.  as it turns out, this behavior is completely normal.  after charging the unit shuts itself off and has to be powered back on using an unmarked button on the face of the battery.  somehow i completely managed to miss this little detail and thought the battery was defective.at any rate, battery works great and is good for a couple phone charges at least.  the device loses one star only because of the impenetrable user interface and mysterious button that my work colleagues found only by chance randomly mashing the face of the thing.  if i had purchased the item i would have found this a very frustrating product.  but you, now armed with this secret, can use the device without difficulty i am sure.","received this unit in exchange for a review. actually, i received two units in exchange for a review "
231,"as with other reviewers, i received this charger at no cost in exchange for writing a review.  because i do not own a smart phone, i gave the charger to my middle aged daughter to try out.this is her reviewalthough i had seen external battery chargers on tv shopping channels before, i had not seen the need for purchasing one for myself.  but since i like to know what new gadgets are out there, my mother thought i might to try this with my iphone.  many of the other reviewers seem to be 8220techie8221 people and their reviews reflect their vast knowledge of electronics.  i am not a 8220techie8221 person, so my thoughts are strictly from a novice point of view.when i first opened the package and found the user manual, i had high hopes of seeing instructions inside.  after finding no instructions, i went to amazon.com to read the other reviews on how this charger works.  only then did i find out that the black screen will not light up like my itouch does, but that the 3 blue lights will light up showing the amount of charge the unit currently has.  for the price listed on amazon, i was not expecting to find a cord that would fit my iphone, which is fine because i have plenty of cords.  i had no clue what 3100mah meant, other than it was some type of measure, so had to google that.  i then had to go back to amazon.com to see what mah other chargers had.after charging the unit, i plugged in my iphone and it charged in about an hour and a half.  i was happy with that, and so recharged to unit and put it on my ipad.  after charging the unit twice, it hardly did anything to my ipad.  so back to amazon.com to see what mah is needed to charge an ipad.  i then gave the charger to a coworker to use, who has also never had an external battery charger.  she and her daughter both used the charger for their iphones for a couple of days and were very happy with the unit.in summary, for the price i think it is a great unit for my iphone and itouch.  and i don8217t mind the writing on the back of the unit.  because i carry my itouch in my purse most of the time, with the writing on the charger, i can quickly determine which unit is which.  i would ask only for some instructions included with the unit.vikki madsen on behalf of joan adamak","as with other reviewers, i received this charger at no cost in exchange for writing a review."

224,"at 3100mah, this compact, easytostashandgo, external battery charger falls into its own little niche so i think, 5 star americas boast that it is the thinnest and fastest charging 34in the world34 may be absolutely correct for the moment, that is.... but i wouldnt bet on it....to give this battery charger its due it does exactly what it claims to do. and that is a good thing. the fact that it works exactly as it should is worth a fourstar rating. it has a good warranty also.why, then, not five stars? i have a major problem carting around free advertising for any company. the logo and wording that you see in the pictures on this product page is on the backside of the charger. it is permanent, it is inyourface glaring, and it is hideous. maybe it doesnt look so bad on a neutral color, but i have this in hot, bright pink. plus, i dont mind that the product is made in china, but the advertising 34designed for america34 and stars and stripes in the logo seems a bit misleading to me. and not that it is a make or break detail, but the pink cable that comes with the charger is not an exact match either.another thought im not sure what value it is to charge a device with this battery while you are charging the battery. i would think that if you had a source of power you would just charge your device and be done with it. maybe im missing something?  because, even though you might have them both hooked up together, it8217s not charging both at full power  it is dividing the power between the two  you are not saving any time.my advice is to think through the situations you may find yourself in, where you might need to use this. peace of mind is very important. how much peace of mind do you need or want? then check out the sabrent external battery chargers before you decide on this one sabrent has a slim, unobtrusive, business cardsized 400mah model sabrent slim credit card sized charge card adapter for micro usb with 400mah emergency external battery backup charger power bank charger pbrscc that will get you a few extra hours charge for your phone, on up to some super sharp and svelte models at 6100mah and 12000mah.i received a sample product from 5 star america.",i received a sample product from 5 star america.
212,"at first glance, this looks like an extended battery that would clip to the back of a phone. but instead, it8217s a conventional powerbank that allows you to recharge pretty much any device.the downside to this slim and sleek design is capacity 8211 only 3100mah. that8217s fine for a single recharge of a typical phone, or a partial charge for a larger device such as a tablet.the overall build quality is very good. it feels very solid and wellmade. there8217s a single usb output port rated at 2.1a. the input is a micro usb port. it measures about 2.5 inches wide and 4.5 inches long, and is about a quarter of an inch thick. the edges are rounded to make it look even slimmer and sleeker. however, this elegant design is somewhat marred by all the logos and printing on the back. really ruins the overall look. i won8217t detract from the rating due to that, but it is a disappointment.it includes the typical 8220gas gauge8221 consisting of led light that show the amount of charge left in the powerbank. it also includes a usb cable that is colormatched to the device i have the red version. the cable is flat to make it easy to manage, and keeps with the thin and slim design cues throughout.great powerbank 8211 well worth a look if you want the slimmest one out there.sample provided for review",sample provided for review
435,"battery cases are pretty common now, making it hard to choose between them.  unu sent me this one to review, so ill try to quickly outline what it offers.first, it does add some bulk and weight.  however, i have found iphones so fragile that i wouldnt think of using one without a case anyway, and this is less bulky than something like a waterproof otterbox.  for a battery case, it is pretty thin and looks nice, if not super sleek.  importantly, it is sturdy plastic and does a good job protecting the phone.to charge the phone, the case plugs into the phones lightning port.  what i love is that, rather than sticking a lightning port on the case for charging or syncing, unu went with microusb.  this is the universal standard for almost everything other than apple products, so i have plenty of those cables around.what about wireless charging?  well, it is not the usual qi or similar standard of inductive charging.  in fact, it is a bit of a misnomer to call it wireless at all.  the charging pad consists of two metal plates with magnets.  the back of the case has two metal pins, which extend via the magnets to touch the plates.  so, it is basically using pins rather than wires, similar to a standard phone cradle.  with that said, it works well and i do like the convenience, apart from the magnets occasionally wanting to stay stuck and attach the mat to the phone.  the downside is that a standard wireless charging mat will not work with the phone, so if you already have a nice one for your gadgets, that could be something to consider.overall, the unu aero series case is an impressive and simple way to keep your iphone safe and juiced up.","unu sent me this one to review, so ill try to quickly outline what it offers."
401,"battery cases for iphones are usually expensive, but they are also, sometimes, a necessary evil. using lots of data while using some apps really wears on a batterys uptime. we are not always in close proximity to ac power for a recharge. that is why i always want to be prepared with a little extra oomph. the new unu aero wireless charging iphone 55s battery case is unus latest offering in that department. i received a free sample of the unit for a review. i have had great experiences with unu products in the past, using their chargers for my iphone 4, 4s and 5.the new aero battery case is wireless and that means you dont have to fumble with wires and plugs after the initial setup. when your iphone and battery needs a charge, you place the phone on the charging mat which you keep plugged in, and take it away when you need it. i didnt keep track of how long the charging process takes. other reviewers seem to have that info covered.  what about the case, comfort, weight, etc?the aero battery case which holds the phone away from the charging pad is a two piece unit that contains the battery and a snapon bumper to keep the phone in place. once connected, the case is very comfortable to hold. it may be the most comfortable unu battery case ive ever held. the added battery weight is negligible but the 2000mah is a little shy of unus other iphone5 case the unu dx case. as with previous cases for the iphone 5, any headphone usage will need the included headphone extension cable. the bumper snapon is my only concern.although every two piece battery pack out there has the potential for damage, i fear that if the aero case goes through a lot of installuninstall cycles, the bumper feels like it may not last as long as the battery. replacement bumpers maybe even some with colors should be an available accessory. an extra bumper included in the original packaging would be welcome.  another welcome sight would be a case for the 5c, which every battery maker seems to be avoiding, for some reason.", i received a free sample of the unit for a review.

321,"before writing the review i wanted let you know this item was provided to me by unu at free of cost for testing and reviewing it . i was not required to write a positive review. the below review is written after using it for a reasonable amount of time and trying to compare it with other existing products in the market.quality and design  this product stands out in quality when compared to the other products in the market. the plastic  cable would have loved to have the cable longer the build and the design. it fell more than couple of times from a table of around 3 4 feet height, and worked perfectly well even after that with no visible damages. my one and half year old daughter threw it thinking it was her toy not with heavy destructive force but nonetheless a decent throw with no before or after thoughts , and it withstood this without any visible damages and was able to charge the equipment even after that.reliability   i couldnt find a single flaw nor it failed a single time in my usage. i feel the reliability of the product is too good in comparison with similar products. it charges iphone 5s and nexus 5 for two near to two charges around 1.61.8 times when i tried it multiple times charging them when they were at 5 percent of their battery life. ipad could be charged for one time when charging it with this product.whats good about this  size,small can be placed any where. in a hand bag or in a pocket or you can just keep it in your car. can be charged using any mini usb charger in car or at home.  i was able to charge this fully on wall charger, using my mac , using a windows desktop and in the car with a mini usb charger with wall charger varying from 1amp to 2.1 amp.whats lacking in the product  letting me know how much amount of charging is left in the battery. the approximations specified by the lighting calculations vary drastically from 25 to 33 .  when i compare this with other higher capacity products this stands nowhere. the price point i see is varying drastically when comparing with similar products available in the market. you are getting similar product with not the same quality at half the price and with double the power. so i feel the price is on a higher side.",before writing the review i wanted let you know this item was provided to me by unu at free of cost for testing and reviewing it .
634,"before you buy this, make sure you really want a 15000 mah charger. this charger is not what i would call portable in the sense that you would want it in a purse or hand bag or, even worse, a pocket. it is, by all measures 34massive34 in size a given due to the capacity.as long as you know you arent getting something easily pocketable and dont mind, then what you get with this battery is massive capacity, dual device charging capability, premium samsung battery cells and a great lcd display so you know exactly what percentage of the charge is available. the last part, the lcd display, shouldnt be discounted as a silly feature. when you press the power button, the display lights up and indicates exactly how much power is left via a percentage. this is superior to how just about every other power bank works, as most others offer a set of lights that you just to guess is 025, 2550, 5075 or 75100. you will know exactly when you should be plugging this into the wall.there are two charging ports, which can be used simultaneously to charge devices. again, this shouldnt be taken lightly as the ability to charge more than one device can be quite a boon in todays digital age. one is a 2a the other is a 1a port. the 2a should be used for tablets and phones designed to use the 2a speed, while the 1a should be used for phones and other devices and it should be noted, you can still charge a tablet on the 1a port, it just takes longer to charge the tablet.the flashlight is fairly bright, but wont replace a maglite. in an emergency, it can be a nice to have, but since the device isnt the most portable, im not sure of the actual utility of such an option  more than likely you wont be running around town with this in your pocket.keep in mind this is heavy. the capacity dictates quite a large battery cell be included, and battery cells add weight obviously.at 15000 mah, you can get one full charge on an ipad, or up to ten charges of an iphone 5s assuming 100 efficiency and so on  most likely you would be looking at 8 or 9 full charges. depending on your use case, this could be a life saver.overall, i am quite happy with this power bank. if you need the capacity, this is definitely my first recommendation given the lcd display is quite good.highly recommended.i received a free sample for review purposes.",given the lcd display is quite good.highly recommended.i received a free sample for review

918,"disclaimer  i received a free copy of this product for review purposes, but that did not influence my review or rating at all.i wasnt sure how well this mini speaker would work considering its size to be a possible limitation.  i was pleasantly surprised to find out that this sound quality of this speaker is extremely professional!  whether i was connecting it to my phone, ipod, or laptop, the sound was always eons better than the sound from the device without the mini speaker attached to it.using the mini speaker is extremely simple.  the mini speaker comes with two cords, one with a usb plug in, and you simply use one of the cords to attach the speaker to your electronic device.  there is a suction cup on the back of the speaker that is useful for sticking it on your laptop or phone, but i really dont find myself using this feature.  when i do use it, it works very well, though.the only thing thats not perfect about this device is the static that emits from it when i have it attached to a device but dont have anything playing from it.  its a really high pitched static whine that is fairly annoying, but it never seems to occur when the speaker is in use.in fact, nothing every seems to affect the quality that comes from the speaker.  its always the same high quality every time i use it, and ive begun to use the speaker quite often to listen to music or the radio on my laptop or phone.  i definitely recommend this speaker to those looking for a cheap yet high quality portable mini speaker.  the static is definitely a small flaw, but everything else is professional about this speaker.","disclaimer  i received a free copy of this product for review purposes, but that did not influence my review or rating at all."
398,"disclaimer  i received the case and wireless pad free from unus you try it program.i was very excited to get this new case and pad.  i previously had the red dx5 and loved it.  although it was rather big, it protected my phone extremely well.  i have a 10 month year old baby and dropping my phone has become more frequently than before.  the new case is amazingly smaller and a lot lighter.  its easier to put on than my other case.  my only issue is that when it has dropped the top part of the case comes off so far i have been very lucky and nothing has happened.  maybe its just me that needs the durability of the dx5 because that to me is by far better than the otter boxlife proof, etc.  but this review is not about the dx5.  i think the idea of the wireless pad is amazing.  i love just putting it on the pad next to my bed, not having to worry about plugging it in.  and when someone calls i dont have to worry about unplugging the cord.  it also transfer to my laptop through the pad which is even more amazing.  the whole set up is great.  to me this pad is the next great technology!  wireless everything!  unfortunately it doesnt hold the charge that the dx5 held but to be honest, it hasnt been an issue.  another great creature is that i can turn on the battery when i want, unlike the dx5 where it turns on automatically and you have to remember to turn it off before you waste it.  to me this product is a keeper.  i would love to see them design the case a little more durable to where if its dropped, the clip on part doesnt come off and thus, not protect the phone.  but besides that, i am going to buy more wireless pads, and pray it keeps my phone from breaking!  i also cant wait for unu to bring out accessories like a wallet case and such!  overall, i am extremely happy with the product and will definitely be using this one over my dx5!",disclaimer  i received the case and wireless pad free from unus you try it program.
929,"disclaimer anker provided me with a unit free of charge so that i might post my complete and unbiased opinion on their product. they also asked me to include any recommendations for improvement i might have, so what follows are my honest feelings and they arent in any way tempered by ankers generosity or my admiration of their corporate culture. instead, my feelings are based on having lived with the product for about a week and using it as frequently as it would otherwise normally fit into my routines.i was sent the mushroom unit. fortunately, i was already in the market for a bluetooth speaker because 1. my car stereo had stopped working and i dont really have a lot of time over the course of the semester to run it down to a sound shop to get it replaced and 2. my laptop speakers are disappointingly low. i had hoped this speaker would allow me to resume listening to audiobooks during my daily commute, and relax at home with movies or music a bit more comfortably.the good1. great battery life  i charged the speaker as soon as i got it and havent charged it since.2. rubber bottom  for the most part, the speaker has spent its time with me on the dashboard of my car, and he hardly budges from there, no matter how hard i swerve or brake. in part, this is due to the frictionfull bottom, but also the mushroom design. well done.3. easy pairing process  i have an android phone, my wife has an iphone, and both of us were able to connect to the speaker pretty easily.4. good performance  louder than the integrated speakers on most smartphones, tablets, and computers.the bad1. the sound isnt as high as some other speakers in this price range, nor is its clarity. for my audiobooks and music, the clarity was good enough, but when watching movies, well, the speaker is clearly not meant to be enjoyed that way.2. cant connect to multiple devices simultaneously  in order to connect to my wifes iphone, i had to first unpair the device from my android phone. i think i understand why this has to be this way, but thats not to say it wasnt both disappointing and frustrating when she whined for five minutes about it not working.3. sleep mode  okay, so it seems like this thing enters some sort of sleep mode if you forget to turn it off and only come back to it much later. this could explain the great battery life. the downside to this though is that try as you want to, your device wont automatically reconnect to the speaker unless you manually turn it off and on again, which is annoying because the switch is on the bottom of the device, meaning you will have to fumble with the thing every time you want to use it. id rather have had a reset button built into the top of the speaker instead, or otherwise just something i can push down on to pair with my phone without having to lift the speaker up.4. i havent used the phone button. i have used the volume buttons though. neither are in a very accessible position. so what if theyre on the front face? unless you have tiny fingers, its impossible to push those buttons unless you, again, lift the device up. again, i have enough gizmos and gadgets to play with. its time i had something that disappears into my surroundings.the bottom line its a good wireless speaker for its price. its hardly the loudest, most feature friendly, or even nicest looking i hate that it collects fingerprints like whoa, but itll probably fit the bill nicely for most people who go looking for a wireless speaker as its small, lightweight, and doesnt clash with the surrounding as several other speakers do. but to be clear, its not for everybody.so would i recommend it? sure, if its the sort of thing you want. is it a musthave? not really.",disclaimer anker provided me with a unit free of charge so that i might post my complete and unbiased opinion on their product.
348,"disclaimer as with the power dx model, unu sent me a free aero wireless review unit. ive put it through its paces for three months now and feel comfortable sharing my thoughts.speaking of thoughts, i must admit that my first one, upon hearing of this particular case, was whats the point? sure, its neat from a tech perspective, but is there much of a difference between placing your phone on a mat versus plugging in a charger cable?the short answer yes. its no newsflash that people can be lazy, especially when it comes to a task you perform constantly, like making sure your phone is charged. the aero allows me to simply set my iphone on the deskwhere i normally keep my phone, during working hoursand it charges. its that easy. not once did the phone fail to charge. i imagine if you managed to dirty up the back of your case, that may prevent the contacts from connecting to the charger mat. mind you, thats never happened in my experience. another perk that i didnt expect is that the phone seems to charge faster. even after three months of use i remain skeptical on that, since i would actually expect conductive charging to be slightly slower than direct.theres no doubt that the aero wireless is a convenient case, especially for people constantly onthego. theres nothing stopping you from buying multiple charger mats, which would make it even better one for the office, one on your nightstand, etc. my only complaint about the case is the build quality, and this is only partially because im comparing it to the beautiful power dx. the case is actually a battery you slide your phone into, plus a plastic bumper that clips around it. i went with the white case, which has a glossy, smooth finish that still makes me nervous about dropping if the black case has a different finish, i must have missed that in the product listing. the bumper cover has cutouts that allow access to everything you need, save for the power button. the power button is too recessed to hit through the bumper cover, so there is a builtin, raised plastic button that hits it for you. i noticed right off that this button was very firm and required pressing just the right way, in order to successfully trigger. this button broke off after a month of use. this could be fixed by replacing the bumper cover, as the button is too tiny to try gluing back on. also, just today i noticed that the bumper wasnt fastening 100 on one side, and after removing my phone i saw another tiny piece of plastic had broken off one of the clips that attaches the bumper to the battery. the plastic doesnt seem to be very strong, obviously. not all is bad with the aeros form factor, though! i do rather like the led display, on the back, that tells how much juice is left in the battery. a simple button press lights up four surrounding blue leds.this isnt a case you buy because you want to protect your phone, though. you get this case because, yes, it is very convenient to use your phone, set it down to charge, pick it back up, and repeat said process a dozen times without worrying about a cord. i find myself using the aero when im home, then switching to my power dx whenever i leave the house. if unu revisits the design of the aero someday, i would wholeheartedly recommend it without hesitation. as it is, its a wonderfully convenient case, with some caveats. i just dont know that i would choose it over the power dx.","disclaimer as with the power dx model, unu sent me a free aero wireless review unit."
839,"disclaimer i received a complimentary review copy of this product from the company, infigear.let me start by saying i am not a techperson.  tech hates me.  regardless of how much i spend or what i buy, nothing ever works right for me.  i am married to a techloving guy though, so i am surrounded by technology ps3, xboxkinect, 3d tv, dvrs, roku, 3d bluray, theater surround sound  you name it, we have it.  i am not in charge of any of it  cant make most of it work to save my life.  but im the one that hears the household complaints when things dont work  and the one who pays the bills.weve paid a fortune for hdmi cables in the past, and found them rather lacking.  the lengths arent always true, the packaging requires a blow torch to open, the ends have to be wiggled justso to work.  not this time.  the infigear cable is unbelievably inexpensive, well packaged, easy to open, heavy duty, true length, and offers a nice tight fit no matter how many times it gets disconnected or fussed with.  it shipped on time, arrived on my doorstep as expected.  the audiovisual is at least as good as the more expensive brands, if not better.this is, in short, a fabulous product at an even more fabulous price.",received a complimentary review 
383,"disclaimer i received from unu a free sample of this product to review. this is the fifth unu charger case that i have used over 3 models of iphones. like the others, this one performs exceptionally. the battery supports a full recharge for the iphones built in battery. the feature that unu provides that other brands ive used dont provide that is most helpful to me is that itunes will recognize the device using the supplied micro usb cable rather than pulling the phone out of the battery case to attach the iphone cable directly. starting out with the unit i wondered how useful the separate charging mat would really be versus just attaching the cable to the charger case. i fell in love with that feature almost immediately. i could just set the phone down and not have to mess with the cable. while that might seem like a small thing, i found it very convenient, and had i purchased, to be worth the few extra dollars over the model without the mat. i travel a lot, so the only thing i would want differently than the way the unit is packaged is to have a second mat included. that way i could just leave one at home and have another that just travels. i will purchase a second mat for that purpose. there is also one feature ill ask the company to consider in future versions, i would find a kickstand really useful.",disclaimer i received from unu a free sample of this product to review.
507,"disclaimer i received these earbuds as a product tester for the manufacturer.i was impressed with the quality of the packaging itself.  im not one usually for plastic packaging as another reviewer said, you always seem to cut yourself... but the packing on these had a collapsible box that you could simply open the bottom without worrying about slicing a finger.it did take me a moment to find the instructions which as others have said are located inside the cardboard box.  the product seems wellbuilt, especially for the price point on it.  i had no trouble connecting them to my iphone 5 on the first shot and they worked flawlessly.the only thing that really kept me from giving them a 5 star review was the sound itself.  please keep in mind...for the casual listener not incredibly concerned with tones, they are great.  for those of us who have any type of background in sound mixingno matter how far in the past, you may find these earbuds are a little heavy on the treble and light on the bass.  not a killer by any means but just not quite perfect.once again,  it is important to note that most people probably are not going to notice this and i was able to help the problem some by changing the eq settings on the phone.overall they definitely seem well built and for the price are definitely a great buy.",received these earbuds as a product tester for the manufacturer.i was impressed with the quality of the packaging itself.  im not one usually for plastic packaging as another reviewe

254,"disclaimer i received this product in exchange for an honest review.okay, you may see looking through my profile that i review a lot of external chargers. im certainly no expert, but i do find them to be practical devices. so, with that in mind, i have found this charger to be of above average quality. the specs seem right. i was able to charge my samsung galaxy twice completely with a bit of charge remaining in the charger afterward. i was also able to charge my kindle fire completely once before the charger drained. it is exactly the same size as the majority of cell phones making the charger completely useful on a daily basis. the usb cord included was also very high quality and was a nice surprise, especially considering that most chargers i receive have run of the mill cords. the look of the charger is nice as well. quite sleek.my only real issue is actually with the user manual. it actually says to read before using the device, but the instructions are on where to review the product and how to contact the company rather than focusing on the device itself. possibly the worst user manual of all time. still, thats a minor issue since you only really need to plug it in to use it, and the charge indicator lights up when in use.update this charger has continued to decline in effectiveness since originally receiving it. what used to be a reasonably quick charge is now excruciatingly slow. i had my blackberry plugged into this the other day and it literally took 4 hours to charge the phone a little less than halfway. i have revised my rating accordingly. it still does work, just not that well.","disclaimer i received this product in exchange for an honest review.okay, you may see looking through my profile that i review a lot of external chargers. im certainly no expert, but i do find them to be practical devices. so, with that in mind, i have found this charger to be of above average quality. the specs seem right. i was able to charge my samsung galaxy twice completely with a bit of charge remaining in the charger afterward. i was also able to charge my kindle fire completely once before the charger drained. it is exactly the same size as the majority of cell phones making the charger completely useful on a daily basis. the usb cord included was also very high quality and was a nice surprise, especially considering that most chargers i receive have run of the mill cords. the look of the charger is nice as well. quite sleek.my only real issue is actually with the user manual. it actually says to read before using the device, but the instructions are on where to review the product and how to contact the company rather than focusing on the device itself. possibly the worst user manual of all time. still, thats a minor issue since you only really need to plug it in to use it, and the charge indicator lights up when in use.update this charger has continued to decline in effectiveness since originally receiving it. what used to be a reasonably quick charge is now excruciatingly slow. i had my blackberry plugged into this the other day and it literally took 4 hours to charge the phone a little less than halfway. i have revised my rating accordingly. it still does work, just not that well."

560,"disclaimer i was provided a free unit for testing purposes by maxboost. i agreed to post a fair and impartial review after my testing.reviewi love this thing. i have never used an external battery pack for my electronics before, so this is all new to me. i have had my maxboost electron 10000mah gizmo for a few months now. for discharge testing purposes, i used a samsung note 8.0 inch tablet and a samsung galaxy mega 6.3 phablet. both very hungry devices. i purposely drained both of the samsungs down to near zero to see what the maxboost would do. i attached the tablet first and allowed it to charge for about twenty minutes with no other drain on the battery pack. my tablet charged much more quickly than i expected. nice ! now, the real test  i added on the mega to charge. charging two large devices at the same time slowed down the charging noticeably. i did expect that. both devices indicated charging states as normal  as if i had plugged them into the wall chargers. i was able to get both the tablet and the mega up to about 60 percent charged before the maxboost gave out. the devices were charging behind me while i worked, so when i began hearing the connecting to chargerdisconnecting noises coming from the samsungs, i knew the maxboost was all done in. blink, bloink,bloink,bloink, bloink was my cue to give max a break.max, were on a first name basis now recharged just fine back to one hundred percent. now, the heat test. max has been left all by his lonesome in my bag for a couple weeks. this is florida, folks. he has been baked in the trunk multiple times, then refrigerated in our house to a balmy 72 degrees. outdoor temps have been in the mid to upper 90s. i checked on max this afternoon  he is happy and healthy and still charged at 100 percent. frankly, i expected the heat to take the starch outta his collar a bit.living in florida, max will be really handy to have this hurricane season. i appreciate the flashlight. by the way, dont look directly into the led. it seems as bright as the one used for flash on cell phone cameras. i think i burned a hole through my retina and out the back of my head. the led is recessed a bit, so the light is fairly confined and is great for digging in the bottom of my wifes purse. its also pretty handy for reading menus in dimly lit restaurants for us old geezers with bad eyes.now for your favorite part  the pros and conspluses1. it is likely that if you have a normal sized smartphone you could get several charges without reloading max. excellent capacity! i laugh at the puny battery packs i see for sale in every drugstore now. this is the hummer of battery packs.2. led flashlight built in is a nice touch. hurricane charley left me without power for four days. cannot have too many flashlights or too many batteries in florida.3. the window that tells you how many percent left  easy to judge if you need to charge several gadgets, such as on a camping trip.4. its just heavy enough to bonk people on the head pretty good if you throw it, without causing an excessive amount of skull fractures.5. the ends are rounded, difficult to do injury to myself with it.minuses1. kinda heavy, but see number 4 above.2. aside from the percent readout, the other info on the display is too dang small for my eyes. if your vision corrects to 2020 dont worry about it.3. see number five above.  i have those kind of days sometimes.  conclusionits priced about right, i like it. would have eventually purchased one anyway. what is most important to me is it works as advertised !!! i really hate electronics that sorta kinda do what they are supposed to do. max behaved well under touch circumstances for me. good boy, max ! now sit ! .....oh wait...you already are sitting..... darn thing can read minds, too....",provided a free unit for testing purposes by maxboost. i agreed to post a fair and impartial review after my testing.reviewi
407,"disclaimer unu provided me with a free sample unit in exchange for this review.i like the idea of this product wireless charging and a battery case. there are cases that just add wireless charging capability or just add an extra power, and its nice to see a product that combines both. the case adds some extra bulk both in the weight of the phone, and about a centimeter at the bottom. the extra height is unfortunate, but needed to add this capability considering the case does so much it may be worth it.  the case requires a headphone adapter which it comes with and i just leave on my headphones. the case includes a screen protector which is nice for some extra protection. the way the case functions, you have to trigger the battery it isnt automatically draining from it which allows you to time your extra juice but does require an extra step.the wireless charging works as advertised, its sitting on my desk right now charging. in terms of the pad, it is pretty tiny, less than the height of the iphone and very thin. it has a built in magnet however the magnet is not that powerful, the phone can get slid off fairly easily. the pad comes with a cable that is very tiny and i used my amazonbasics cable which i highly recommend b00c28l5uwoverall the convenience of the wireless charging makes thing worth it. before this case i had to worry about charging my phone because it wouldnt make it through a full day with typical use. this wasnt a huge issue, but now with the convenience of the wireless charging and extra battery i barely have to think about charging.edit after using it for over a week, i have gotten a this accessory is not compatible with this device message a few times. this causes the phone to stop charging. however it always eventually resumes and while im not happy, it hasnt been a huge issue.",disclaimer unu provided me with a free sample unit in exchange for this review.
273,"disclosure  this unit was sent to me free of charge in exchange for a review.this is a good charger if you are using it only for your phone.  it doesnt work as well on larger electronics like an ipad.the battery is about the size of an ipod.  it is slim and doesnt weigh much.  it comes with a flat microusb cord that prevents the cord from getting tangled.  the unit charged in about two hours.  i was able to charge my phone twice, before the external battery was drained.  my iphone s4 charged from 10 to 100 in an hour and a half.  i like that the battery doesnt have an onoff button. it is activated when you connect your phone to the unit.  my last external battery charger had an onoff button and i would accidentally turn it on when i carried it in my back pack.i tried using the battery to charge my ipad and it didnt work well.  it took about two hours to charge it from 10 to 21, and half of the external battery life was gone.  so if you are looking for a battery charger that will effectively charge a variety of electronics you will need to look elsewhere.  i didnt take off any stars for this because the promo copy says it is for charging your phone, not larger items.i was a bit bothered by the heavy advertising on the back.  it made the unit look cheap.  in addition, the advertising also seemed a bit misleading.  the message they want to send is that they are an 34all american34 company, but the product is made in china.  i didnt take away any stars from my rating for this, but i thought it was worth mentioning for those buyers who want to buy products made in the usa.",disclosure  this unit was sent to me free of charge in exchange for a review.
382,"disclosure i received a free sample for review and have been asked to share my experience of the product.so, i was was always jealous of my friend that owned a nexus phone for the 34wireless34 charging feature. the concept of plugging intaking out a charge wire is not a big hassle, but when you have the ability to just place your device on a pad to charge... thats a very nice feature.i ran upon this company unu and saw that they had created a way to put this feature on my iphone 5s and instantly had to find out more information. after filling out some online forms to be a possible product tester, they contacted me back in a very quick manner to send me a sample to try.i was instantly floored at how cool the product was after i got it out of the box. i immediately put the case on my phone and was very happy with the resultsafter you have case on, you just place your phone on top of the pad with the screen side facing upwards and bam! it starts to charge your phone. yes! it charges your phone first before it charges the external battery. this means that they were able to bypass the battery until your phone is fully charged, ensuring that you get more battery time with both the phone and addon battery. when my iphones battery went to 100, the battery charged and it gives you so much more screen time.now, i usually dont run out of battery power for at least a day or up to 2 days because i am not a heavy user of my phone. but i can see the potential of this case due to my wife always killing her iphone battery all. the. time. given such usage, i can see how convenient this device is and how easy it is to use. just place the phone with case on the pad and let it charge. pick it up and its ready for use. no fiddling with a stupid wire.the finish of the case i received mine was white in color is a smooth plastic. yes, a little slippery but looks pretty nice. if you are prone to dropping your phone, be careful  theres a led indicator that shows how much juice the battery has as well as a little button that you press to recharge your phone from the battery.some design changesconsiderations that i would see1 material to be a little more 34grippy34 as accident prone people might drop this thing a lot.2 adding a small lip to the front of the phone to give more protection on the phones screen side.3 make a different case that is just a protective case remove the extra battery so that i can use the charging capabilities without the bulk of more battery.i really believe that this case is a 5 star product even with the minor things i would have preferred, not because it was a sample but because the concept, capabilities, and the execution of the product is very good. i would definitely buy this for someone that drains batteries all day because of the simplicity and extra life it can bring to your phone after a long day of work or travel.",disclosure i received a free sample for review and have been asked to share my experience of the product.
973,"disclosure i received a sample for review from the manufacturer, but i write straightshooting reviews and wont risk my reputation as a reviewer for the sake of a free sample.this adapter is useful for those situations when you want to use, or have no other option than to use, a wired internet connection, and your computing device doesnt have an rj45 jack. slim notebook computers certainly dont have rj45 jacks and they seem to be absent from many devices. perhaps the manufacturers think wireless is good enough.but in some hotels and business venues, wired access is all there is. or you might want a wired connection for added security or especially reliability or speed. in such a case, you plug this adapter into a usb port, plug in the ethernet cable, and youre good to go. just about any modern operating system will recognize the connection without the need for additional drivers.the adapter is capable of use on 100mbit lans, and thats within the capability of a usb 2.0 port. of course, many internet connections deliver much less and that will usually be the limiting speed factor.the adapter seems well made. its lightweight and highly portable, though perhaps slightly larger than some others that ive used. i dont see this as a drawback i think the manufacturer was trying to make the device a little more rugged in a vulnerable area.easily five stars for a device that does exactly what it should with no fuss.","disclosure i received a sample for review from the manufacturer, but i write straightshooting reviews and wont risk my reputation as a reviewer for the sake of a free sample."
441,"disclosure i received the unu aero wireless charging battery case as a free testing sample as part of the 8220utry8221 program. i was not required to write a positive review and i am happy to point out any flaws that i see. i have tested this case in day in and day out use over the last 3 weeks on my iphone 5s.previously i was using the unu dx5 case. i was a bit disappointed that the red color wasn8217t available in the new case but the black was sophisticated and sleek. i was immediately impressed by the thinness and purposeful design which fit the phone like a glove. the integrated volume and power buttons are a nice touch over the previous cutouts. i previously appreciated the large lip of the dx5 and while not nonexistent on the aero case, it is definitely understated, seems to be greater at the base and less at the top, and overall less protective. while the dx5 case was able to provide a 100 charge, this one is able to provide 85. overall, the design is a great compromise and the slightly lower battery size has not been missed.what really sells me on this case are the improvements that unu made when designing this case. the lights are small and blue to make the nonobtrusive especially when charging at night. the case is slimmer and has a nice rubberized surface for grip. the wireless charging is perfect at night as an alternative to fumbling with a cable to connect the phone while halfasleep. in addition to the convenience, it will likely extend the life of the case and cables. the mat is smart enough to allow the phone to be placed at any angle as long as the pins each touch a different side and safe enough that the plates are dead until the phone is placed on them. the case saves money by being able to accept standard microusb connector while offering even greater convenience than the apple lightning connector.when i first got the case, i attached an old blackberry charger to the charging mat. although the phone charged, the battery never reached full capacity and drained very quickly. i was concerned there was something wrong with the case, but upon returning to the iphone cube, the case fully charged. several times i have verified that the case was able to charge the phone from 6020 capacity to full charge and this was during light use. also note that the included headphone cable is slightly smaller than the one included in the dc5 case as i quickly found out. it would be nice if the hole was slightly larger to accommodate more plugs but the oem apple headphones will fit albeit a bit more difficult to get in and out.overall i highly recommend this case and very highly recommend unu in general as their products are very thoughtfully designed. i prefer this case to the dx5 model but both work excellent and i have swapped back and forth. i am happy to answer any questions so please feel free to ask.",disclosure i received the unu aero wireless charging battery case as a free testing sample as part of the 8220utry8221 program.

333,"finally a wireless charging option for the iphone 5.  before i acquired the iphone 5s i was using the samsung galaxy s4.  one of the many accessories i missed was the wireless charging capabilities the galaxy s4 had.  you also were able to choose from so many different covers and cases that worked with the qi receiver wireless charging pad.  i checked what was out in the market for the iphone 5 but nothing seemed to really fit what i was looking for until i had the opportunity to test the unu aero wireless charging case and pad.the case itself is soft to the touch and comes it two separate pieces.  it does a tiny bit of bulk and weight to the phone, but not too much to make much of a difference.  the case has raised buttons for the volume and power controls.  however, it has an open area for the mute switch.  even though it does not have an open area in the bottom for the speakers, it  has two slots located on the front of the case for sound and microphone use.  the camera cutout on the back is quite large, so expect no interference troubles there.the receiver qi pad is extremely lightweight and automatically begins charging you phone as soon as it makes connect with your phone.  believe it or not, this charges faster the normal lightning cable.  i was so impressed with how fast it charges and how long it holds the charge, i ended up acquiring two additional charging pads to have in my office and another in my vehicle instead of using a lightning cable.  keep in mind besides using the wireless pad to charge the phone,  you can always a  micro usb cable to charge the case as well in case of emergencies.  the only thing you really need to get use to is using a headset extension adapter.  since the headphone jack sits far into case, a headphone plug will not be able to fit correctly.  i dont use the same headsets all the time, so i have to make it a point to remember to carry the included headphone jack adapter with me when i plan to use different headphones.one really great feature is the battery usage indicator located on the back of the case.  it has four tiny blue lights to tell you how much battery life is left.  it is pretty accurate too because i have the battery indicator on my phone and i am always comparing the two.when using it to sync to itunes, you just need to use a micro usb cable instead of the apple lightning cable.  this way you dont have to take the case off.this is truly a terrific product and works great.  if you are interested in extra pads here is the linkunu aero series wireless charging pad single mat. like i mentioned before, i used one in my vehicle by placing it in one of the cubbyholes in my dogde durango  works great!updatesince i kept taking the case on and off to test and review other cases on my phone, i broke one of the tabs on my unu aero case and wanted to cry because this is my favorite and pretty much the case i use everyday.  i emailed customer service servicesmyunu.com and they quickly issued me a replacement.  so besides being a great wireless charging case, they have wonderful customer service as well.sample provided for review."," like i mentioned before, i used one in my vehicle by placing it in one of the cubbyholes in my dogde durango  works great!updatesince i kept taking the case on and off to test and review other cases on my phone, i broke one of the tabs on my unu aero case and wanted to cry because this is my favorite and pretty much the case i use everyday."
415,"first and foremost  i received this product from unu as a 34free sample34 to review. regardless of that, i make sure all of my reviews are unbiased and honest, as the consumer should know and understand the truths about products to make an educated decision on whether they should purchase them or not.onto the unu aero series battery case for iphone 55s...id like to start with the look, feel and overall aesthetics of the product case and mat. it has a nice matte finish, which i will be biased about  because i love matte finishes on electronic products!  i love the feel and everything about it makes it look of higherquality, in my opinion of course. the case itself covers the iphone decently, not amazingly. when fully installed, you will notice that there is a small portion of the outer lipedge surround the phone that is still exposed. this is very little and not a big deal, but could be annoying to some. it provide two open slits on the front of the case as a means of exposing the sound from your phones speakers only problem with this is that your iphones speakers are located on the bottom of the phone, not the front. therefore, you are not getting the absolute bestdirect sound that you could be from your phone. it still doesnt do a bad job though, as i have noticed only a slightly decrease in sound volumequality  not a deal breaker. on the bottom of the case, you will find a port for your headphone jack, as well as a charging port microusb, which you will use to charge both your iphone and the case itself. there is no apparent issues with the charging port, aside from it needing to be somewhere else so that the speakers slits can be on the bottom! hehe. the headphone jack requires a certain size adapter included so that you can connect any one of your auxheadphone cables. the reason this is necessary is that when the case is on, you will notice that there is an obvious depthlength between the phones jack and the cases. and being that this hole is a certain size, the headsconnectors of many of your standard cables will be too widelarge to fit in this opening, and you will therefore not be able to get it far enough to actual connect it into the phone. the adapter is great and all, but it is a single, small adapter that you will have to carry on you everywhere if at any moment you want to play something on your phone. the task here is not in lugging it around as it is very small obviously, but in not losing it. ive also tested all of this out, attempting to connect my various aux cables i have lying around the house 5 and not a single one of them would fit into the hole on the case without this adapter. thats not to say that you dont have one that may fit, but i myself have had no luck. protectionwise, the case is alright..but lets face it, this is a charging case. although i am sure it is considered during development, the main purpose of this case and others alike is to charge to your phone. so for obvious reasons, this case is no otterbox, lifeproof, nor anything of that nature. minor bumps, dings and perhaps even falls may not damage anything, but you need be a lot more cautious than you would if you had an otterbox defender on it. this case does not come with a screen protector of any sort, as most charging cases dont. i had some spares laying around and threw one on there separate from the case and was good to go. the opening on the back of the case for the phones camera is superb. its a perfect fit and deep enough to prevent most things from touching your camera lens in any way. ive also found the depth of this opening to be helpful in taking pictures, as it aids in blocking out any other interferences that you would normally have coming in from the sides of the camera lens  towards the bottom back, you will find a small rectangular button to both engage the cases battery andor to check the battery life of the case. simple. does the job. no problem there. you will find two small magnets on the back. these help secure the phone to the charging mat when place on it. this prevents the phone from easily falling off. this is a good idea, and works well although ive noticed that the magnets tends to scratch up the mat.onto the mat..attractive, sleek and lightweight. there is not much to say here, as it is fairly simple and gets the job done. the design is attractive. the back of the mat has two grips that prevent it from sliding when placed on a surface. from my experience, this has worked well....and onto the most important part of any product, its performance. right? as ive read other reviews write, 34it works as described.34 i agree. it efficiently and successfully charges your iphone when your battery is drained and you are in desperate need of some juice because lets face it, the iphones battery life is 34okay34 at best the time it takes to charge up is fairly accurate to what is stated in the manual. are some cases faster at this? sure. are some cases worse? definitely. it holds up well compared to others i have used in the past. it is important to note, and forgive me as i am not perusing the manual as i state this i am fairly certain that it does not charge your phone up completely, as in 0 to 100. instead, i believe it to be about 90 not an issue whatsoever. i dont recommend letting your phone die completely before rushing to charge it up anyways, as you will have that time period you have to wait before it is charged enough to turn back on.now about a one to two weeks into using this product, my charging mat started to 34act up.34 i would get the dreadfully annoying, 34this accessory may not be supported.34 in addition to this, at times i would place my phone on the mat and it would begin to charge and as soon as i turned my head back to check, it wouldnt be charging anymore. by some random and unexplainable 34force,34 this stopped happening to me and my mat charges with no problem now. i still get the annoying message, but it does not interfere with the charging itself. and yes, i troubleshooted this problem with different microusb cords and things of that nature.but, this issue resolved on its own, by the gods? brings me to my last aspect to review  customer service. just as important, if not more important than the look, design and performance of the product itself, is the companys customer service. the product can be great and all, but if something happens and you dont have a reliable and helpful customer service to turn to, youre kinda screwed.during my 34charging mat problem,34 i emailed unus customer service about my issue and getting it resolved. now some companies, especially if you are sent a free product will inform you in the nicest most disguised way, that you will not be getting a new one nor will you send this product back to us without dishing out a little money. messed up, i know, but sometimes thats the case.however, this was not the case with unu. i got a response back within a day i believe and they offered to take the item back, inspect it, fix it and from the reply, i assume  issue a new one if it couldnt be fixed. they even attached a prepaid shipping label so that the mat could be shipped out right away, free of charge. now i know a lot of companies do that now, but many still dont. therefore, i am still appreciative when i get that opportunity with a product and company.ladies and gentlemen  overallthis is a good, reliable product. for what it does and how efficiently it does it, i do believe 99.95 is a steep price. i can only assume that it is more expensive due to the fact that you get the addition of this charging mat. its cool and all, yes. it is also nice to throw your phone on there without having to have a wire actually connected to your phone a nice little added benefit. it is not however, completely necessary. i have come across other charging cases that do just as good of a job for a little more than half the price of this. but you wont get the charging mat, obviously. if you have the hundred bucks to spend on a case, it will be money well spent. if you are looking to spend less, you will surely find other charging cases that do just as good of a job.",first and foremost  i received this product from unu as a 34free sample34 to review.

325,"first of all i would like to thank the people over at unu products, i received the aero series iphone 5s battery case for free as part of a sample reviewer. i had received the black aero battery case, i just love the feel of the matte texture its smooth  feels  fits very comfortably in the palm of your hand and its light not heavy at all and its very burable. excellent life span as far as how long it holds the charge. i can honestly last 22 12 days without having to recharge both my iphone and the areo case, depending on usage of course. i also love the ability of the wireless charging, very convenient no need to plug and unplug your device very single time. now here comes the but  my 2 star rating, 2 issues with this charging case, it only lasted a week it was working perfectly up until this morning. the aero case itself would charge but my iphone wouldnt even turn on indicating that it was charging, ive tried my wifes  my daughters iphones  still wouldnt charge them either. i would get this message on all 3 iphones  this cable or accessory is not certified and may not work reliably with this iphone and this could probably be due to the lightening pin on the aero case was already slightly bent im not sure if this could be the cause of it because it did work properly for a week. im very disappointed with this case only because it doesnt work anymore, ive had the previous unu case it still works flawlessly so unu does make great products.","first of all i would like to thank the people over at unu products, i received the aero series iphone 5s battery case for free as part of a sample reviewer."
350,"first of all, let me preface this by saying i was provided a sample to provide my complete and honest feedback, and i will do just that.the first thing i noticed was the case was slim and rather light.  although it has a builtin battery, it does not add the bulk to the case that one would think.  the case has a nice smooth feel to the touch, but it does hold fingerprints who cares.  the face is slightly recessed, which is good.  it allows you to place the case facedown without the screen of the phone touching the surface.  its very easy to use.  just plug in the base, and sit the case on it and you are done.  it also uses a micro usb cable that allows you to charge on the go.  the one thing i do not like is there is no earphone built into the case.  it has a hole that allows you to use the provided earphone extension cable.  this is good and bad.  if you forgetlose the extension and your earphone port is angled like my bose, then you have to remove the phone from the case.  the native iphone earphones will fit, however, too far in.  which means, when you remove them, you are pulling on the wire, vs the section of the earphones that are designed to be pulled on, which can cause a short in them.  i recommend leaving your favorite earphones plugged into the extension.  that way, you wont forget them.  that really is my only negative.that said, i do recommend the aero series casecharger.  its pretty cool.updated 3252014my above review was made early into my trial.  i have more feedback to add after i have had more time to use the device.the skin on the edges of the device have already begun to peel off and it has been less than a month since since i have had the device.  not a good look for something so new.the device also dings pretty easy when bumping it against stuff and dropping it.lastly, the power button has already broken off, making it close to impossible to power the phone off.all of these small items add up to one big problem.","first of all, let me preface this by saying i was provided a sample to provide my complete and honest feedback, and i will do just that."
327,"first off i received this case 100 free. i did so through unus utry program where they send out samples and then have us review them as payment! i had another unu battery case before and had liked it so when i found out that unu was giving these cases away, i was thrilled. first off this case is thinner than the last case which is a huge improvement. next, i really liked how this case snapped together around my iphone rather than sliding on. it made it much easier to work with the sticker that i have on my back cover to prevent scratches. also new that i really enjoyed, they have implemented buttons over the openings for the power and volume buttons which truly makes life much easier. on the last case, there were just open holes and it was a pain to get use to. they have still kept the power supply plug in which is great in case you dont have your power mat around. mentioning the power mat, it is incredible. no more wondering if i got the cable plugged in the right way or searching for the cable when i dont have my glasses on. it makes everything so simple. and the extended battery really helps with how much iphones drain battery. now i dont have to worry throughout the day whether or not my phone is going to make it, so i use it as much as i want to rather than just when i need it. i really like this time too how the case doesnt automatically kick on after its been on charge. that was another annoyance with the other case. plus this case has 4 leds on the back to let you know how much juice you really have, where the other one only had one and gave you a range depending on what color it was lighting up. this case also protects my iphone incredibly. i have dropped it several times already and thought my screen would have been broke, but not yet!! the only thing that i dislike is the headphone jack. they do send you an extender so that you can use any type of jack, but i wish that it was a big enough hole to be used more universally. some other suggestions to the case would be to try to implement some sort of charging port other than the micro usb hopefully apples lighting. i know that would mean that you would have to be an apple licensed product but it would allow me to use all of my docks and cables i already have. they also connect so much better due to their magnetic tip and they are always secure and the inner ports on the phone never get loose where they can no longer take a charge. i would also love to see an implementation  of the kickstand that i have seen on some of your other devices. and if you could make this waterproof... i would buy this for every iphone ipad and macbook i ever own!",first off i received this case 100 free.

374,"first off i would like to say that i received this product as a free sample for review by unu through their utry program.  while i am glad i received this free, i would gladly pay for one if i ever lost this one.  i really cant say enough good things about this case.  for my birthday earlier this year my son gave me a mophie charging case in purple, the only thing i still love about that case for my iphone which i used, but soon regretting using.  it was bulky, a bit slippery, somewhat hard to take apart, and the worst part is that i had to fight with the case each time i wanted to sync with my computer yes, i know i can sync wirelessly but i like to put my pictures into a file on my computer for backup and the easiest way is connecting it to my computer.  that was pretty much the deal breaker when my son bought a different unu model for his phone and told me he could sync to his computer with the case on the jealousy set in.  i looked up unu and on their website found out about the utry program.when i received the case, the first thing i noticed is the 34made for iphone34 label on the box.  it is packaged very nicely, and easy to take out.  after struggling to get my phone out of the mophie case, putting it into this case was a dream.  it slid right into the back, and then the bumper was quite easy to attach.  i did have to go through and press various parts of the bumper to make sure everything clicked into place.  once it was clicked together, it was hard to pry it apart again.  i was having some issued with the power button i couldnt always get it to press properly.  after prying the case apart i noticed that the button on the case only has a piece on the outer part of the button.  if you press it on the inner part then it wont do anything, but if you press it on the outer part close to the edge of the phone then it will easily press the phones button.i love the blue of the lights in the back, though i did have to read the instructions to figure out how to get the case to start charging you have to hold the button for a few seconds.  i was very surprised by how thin this case is it almost feels like theres nothing on the phone even though i can tell it is a bit thick by looking at the camera cutout.  the rubbery texture also makes it easy to grip and you dont feel like the phone is going to slide out of your hand or off the table.  being able to just place the phone down on the charging pad, without having to plug something into it, makes this case more than worthwhile.  the best part for me is that i can connect it to any micro usb cable on my computer and it automatically syncs!  i havent dropped it yet and dont plan to the mophie did do well in that department in that when i dropped my phone the case had some dings and a crack but my phone was fine so i cant attest to how well it does in that department.overall this is the best case ive ever had for a phone, and ive had many.  i was able to charge my phone to about 90 from a 10 charge, which is better than what i got with the mophie.  the only negative thing i can think of with this case is that it does not come in purple or any other colors, not a deal breaker.  if any issues come up i will be sure to edit my review.  another thing i noticed with this case when charging from the case the phone only gets mildly warm, as opposed to burning hot with the mophie.  this case is well worth the cost!",first off i would like to say that i received this product as a free sample for review by unu through their utry program.
222,"first off, a few qualifiers i8217m no technical expert by any stretch of the imagination.  like most redblooded american males, i figure myself relatively skilled in areas of electronics i can program a vcr, i can work the cable box, i know a thing or two about mp3 players, tablets, and the like but i couldn8217t separate dollars from donuts if i had to dissect any of the gibberish relating to electronic components or how they8217re manufactured.  you have printed 8216specs8217 for all of that stuff which either appear in the advertising or come with the manual, so consult those outlets if that8217s what you8217re looking for.also, because i8217m no real tech junkie, i don8217t do product comparisons.  the difference from, say, one battery to the next, is a particular best established by one who knows how to distinguish those items and that isn8217t me.  as i said, i8217m the guy in the house the wife expects to do a, b, and c when it comes to having items ready for her once they8217re out of the box so, in that regard, i feel more than qualified.however, i was contacted by a vendor and asked to provide a review of 3100mah external battery charger by 5 star america.  i graciously accepted this opportunity, and i8217m pleased to share with you my observations hoping that it might help you make whatever purchase you8217re considering.my wife and i were travelling to an area of the country wherein we knew that cellularwireless reception is awful.  we8217d been there before, and, as such, were familiar with how often our devices had to 8216roam8217 to find a provider and we8217re more than aware of what drain this is on the items battery.  so we took the 3100mah external battery charger with us.  i fully charged the item from my sony laptop it comes with a usb cord equipped to do so at the base of the unit, there are three lights which indicate how fully charged the item is which is a huge plus considering, otherwise, we wouldn8217t have known.  that afternoon, we were doing some hiking about three hour8217s worth, so we knew 8211 with that 8216roaming8217 issue 8211 our batteries would get depleted.  once we arrived at the peak, we checked, and, lo and behold, both our cell phones were down about 50.at this point, i plugged my wife8217s iphone into the external battery, and we started back down the mountain.  by the time we reached the car about 90 minutes later, her iphone was fully charged again.  at that point, i was down to about 30 battery life, and i plugged my iphone in.  mine recharged in about the same time, which was better than i had expected.by the conclusion of this experiment, the 3100mah8217s light indicators was showing only a single light, so i recharged it that evening.  it took about six hours to fully recharge with three lights, and that was entirely acceptable for our needs.  in fact, i would suspect most folks who use these things regularly are probably accustomed to charging them overnight, which would be a good six to eight hours depending upon your sleep time.  if that8217s the case, then you8217re making a good decision in allowing for the external battery to sufficiently charge.it8217s extremely lightweight, probably about what the average cell phone is and it8217s extremely easy to use.  there are separate outlets for charging the battery versus using the battery to charge your separate product one of the side, one of the bottom, and they8217re very easy to distinguish between.  for guys, this thing fits in a pocket easily i carried mine in one of the many zipper flaps on my backpack and, for ladies, it fits easily into a purse or coat pocket, making it ideal.if i had to cite any issue andor concern with the 3100mah, then i can only think of two concerns.first, it8217s almost exactly the same size of the iphone 4 yet thinner.  overnight, when i reached to the bedside table where i normally set my iphone, i kept accidentally grabbing it instead of my phone precisely because of the size issue.  yes, it8217s convenient, but maybe if possible i8217d recommend scaling it down a bit or attaching some kind of raised graphic to the front so that it8217d be easier to distinguish by touch.  it doesn8217t have to be anything big, but, when you8217re in the dark and you might be if you use yours like i did by hiking or camping that may cause some frustration.second, the device comes with a manual, but the manual provides little information by way of operating the device.  now, that could be acceptably explained it is extraordinarily easy to figure out, but hoping to be one of those tech junkies i do admire i find myself often times reading the manual with hopes to learn more.  what info here is, largely, about the manufacturer, and there8217s no depth to any of it.  it would be nice to have some rudimentary instruction, especially if this is the kind of item i8217d want my wife to carry in her purse.  she8217s a nut for manuals, so anything by way of that would be an added plus.otherwise, it worked to my expectations, and i8217d have no complaints about giving it a recommendation.strongly recommended.  if you8217re looking for an external battery to extend the life of your cell phone, the 3100mah is ideal it looks like your phone, it feels like your phone, and it8217s compatible with your phone.  what more could you ask?in the interests of fairness, i8217m

467,"first off, i received this as a free sample for review.  that said, i wish i got it a few days earlier, as my phone died while running the disney marathon.  if i had the battery case i know it would have lasted.i like  the slightly rounded back, the additional bulk it offers, the matte finish, the fact i can just lie it down on the charger, how fast the battery case when active can recharge my 5si dont like  having to either take case off or deal with wifi syncing, how much heat it produces when charging as i usually carry the phone in my pocket.  having to either use a headphone extender or a straight cable for plugging into headphone port.would really like a pass thru lightening port so i can use external accessories  but thats probably asking too much.in short, you want extended battery life, you will make concessions  no matter which brand you buy.. but for quick charging and convenience and nice appearance, you really cant beat this one.","first off, i received this as a free sample for review."

680,"first off, let me get this disclaimer out of the way and then get to review.1. the product was received for free.2. i was not required to write a positive review.i have given this external battery charger a good run thru with the devices that i use regularly. i have an amazon kindle fire 2nd generation that i use daily and my smartphone is a zte majesty.first thing i did when i received the product i went ahead and plugged it up to each device as my battery drained for the sole purpose of discharging the charger completely. i wanted to first test out how long it would take to fully charge and once it was completely depleted. i plugged it in and reached full charge in about 3 hours.now the next thing i did was let my kindle drain down to about 12 and then i plugged the charger in and continued using my kindle like normal at the time i was watching a movie....note it was not streaming the movie....i had downloaded it. the movie was just over 2hours long and i must say i was shocked that when the charger was fully depleted it had charged my kindle up to 88 while watching a movie. amazing! !my cell phone . . .it worked just as well with it. i could charge my cell phone once it was completely depleted up to 100 and still have a charge left on the external charger. anywhere from 2040 depending on my usage on my phone while it was charging.needless to say... this charger is perfect for me. it will always be in the diaper bag anytime i leave the house. its not bulky at all. you could carry it around in the pocket of your jeans and you would forget it was there.my favorite part about this charger is the led screen that lets you know exactly how much percentage of battery power you have left. that is priceless to me. ive had previous chargers before that only have lights that change colors and youre left just kinda guessing how much charge you have left.one thing i do know.... this is going on the list as christmas presents for the family!", the product was received for free.
581,"first off, one thing that you will have to get use to is the weight of this thing. it is pretty heavy, but understandable. i received this product free and for testing purposes. i received the item on monday, and have been using it ever since to see the reliability of it. my job requires me to travel all around my state, so this was a very handy device. i charged the device to 100 and began its use. it comes with an accelerated charge port and a normal charge port. the normal charge port takes about 15 minutes to charge my iphone 5, samsung tab, and ps vita. accelerated works even faster. the beauty of this device is that, it allows for multiple charges without really draining the battery. it took nearly about 7 each normal charge to fully charge my iphone and other devices. personally i find this device incredibly useful and a necessity for someone who is technology dependent in their life and profession. i highly recommend this for any individual who is on the fence for portable batteries such as i was. once again i received this device for free and testing purposes. in addition, i am not required to write a positive review. i have to give a fair and reasonable assessment to the device.pros two ports for multiple charges accelerated charge port allows for multiple recharges before having to recharge the device itself emergency flashlight on the device in case if needed. charges essentially anything that needs a charge through a usb nice designcons a bit on the heavy side adapters provided are only for certain items so you have to rely on your own cord", i received this product free and for testing purposes.
277,"first thing to note about this natty little phone charger is the style mine is orange with sleek black screen in the shape and size of an ipod. it really looks like a phone and my better half at first glance asked if i had bought a new case for my galaxy s4.the supplied usb to micro usb is also worth noting as its the best ive seen, rugged and flat and can be rolled up like a coiled spring.charging involves simply plugging the usb into a power source then plugging it in. theres an orange set of leds which flash during charging then go solid when done. the manufacturers claim that this charger can itself be charged as you use it to charge your phone, but i would imagine that might slow both processes down but its a nice touch to have.after it had charged it recharged my s4 from dead to full in about two hours, but i did use the phone during that period so that will definitely have impeded the process.since this is rated 2.1amps in theory it should charge an ipad at least for a while until the battery flattens and so i hooked it up. but both it, and my ipad, got a little too hot for my comfort implying that 2.1amps as a continuous draw may be too much for it to handle. the makers do not claim this should be used with an ipad or equivalent tablet so im not docking a star.for the price, looks and functionality i give it five stars. its diminutive size and smart phonelike looks means its not out of place in your bag, briefcase or purse and for me at least it does what it says on the box. i was sent a copy of this item in return for my honest review of it. i have no affiliation with the manufacturers nor was i paid for my opinion.",i was sent a copy of this item in return for my honest review of it. i have no affiliation with the manufacturers nor was i paid for my opinion.
933,"first to clarify, since there are several items listed under this same sku, i am reviewing the hanging organizer. complimentary product received.the casem organizer is great way to organize a wide range of items. there are a variety of storage areas including clear pockets, velcro tie downs and elastic slots. there is also a metal hanger that attaches to the top, allowing you to hang it from your closet or a door.  its a great way to keep electric gadgets in order, including cell phones, chargers and wires. my son is actually using ours at the moment. he  has his phone, his ds, all the games, and even his pokemon cards secured with plenty of room still left over. for the time first, hes able to locate all these small items easily, without cords getting tangled or games misplaced. but in addition to electronics, this organizer could also work for lots of other items. you can keep your jewelry sorted, which would especially come in handy if youre traveling. my husband is also considering getting a second one to store his music equipment, like microphone heads and reeds.  the hanging organizer is sturdy with lots of space and many uses.  im very happy with it.",i am reviewing the hanging organizer. complimentary product received.
716,"first, its small. small enough to fit in a pocket, a briefcase, purse, carry on or pack. and if youre on the go as we all are from time to time you wont want to leave home without it. a brilliant blue display that shows status and charge percentage is easily illuminated with one short click. two clicks will activate the little led flashlight handy for finding where things are in the dark and its bright enough to make a tent a little more cozy at night. one long press deactivates the light on the display. the finish is a high gloss piano black. it is also very light, about 14 lb. so youre not adding any weight to your essentials. speaking of which this is definitely an item for your bug out bag. or if youre making a long plane flight, going camping or adventuring it will keep you going. charges just about anything with a usb port and does so quickly. the description says that it will add 40 to 50 on a charge for a tablet but that was a bit conservative in my ipad mini test. i ran the mini down to 18 where i would typically start wanting an outlet or recharge and plugged my cable into the provided port on this battery. it immediately showed me it was charging at 2.1 amps  5 volts. it took about 4 hours to exhaust the battery pack and the charge on the ipad mini showed 85. more than satisfactory, more than i expected. so there are four things i like most about this device 1. the display 2. the  fit and finish 3. charging capacity and 4. charging speed. to sum up, i love this maxboost electron mini. its the perfect mate for my ipad mini. if youre looking to get yourself something youll use and enjoy this is it. also would make a great birthday or christmas gift. i definitely wont be leaving home without it. please note i was provided with a free sample in exchange for a fair and honest review.", please note i was provided with a free sample in exchange for a fair and honest review.
16,"first, this is for the chain, not the organizer  not sure why this shows up as an eitheror item, to be honest. i got this as a free sample for review, and we received just the one chain  the 18inch one  not two as the listing suggested.i chose this for my wife because she needed a new chain to wear with some of her pendants. overall, its stylish and pretty, a good weight and seemingly very strong. this is the perfect length for her, and shes largely pleased with this selection. its exactly what she needed!unfortunately, the chain arrived with a kink in it and, while it was easy enough to smooth it out, a slight bend is still visible where the kink was.", i got this as a free sample for review
82,"first, you need to know that i was contacted by the nice people at ontrion and asked to review this product and thats why it doesnt say verified purchase under my name. im a recording engineer and an electronic tech.my first thought was that you should not be hanging your phone by the port connection, so i researched this. it was easy to find others that thought as i did, however i couldnt find a single instance of this causing a problem with an apple product. as this is not the only product that uses this idea, i must conclude its safe, without finding evidence contradictory, but im still skeptical.as a headset with a microphone, its a communication device that will allow you to hear music. being surrounded by pro audio gear everyday i know im biased, but really, what else should you expect at this price?wearing your phone could be useful, ill let you decide, but its not for me. i also think a carrying pouch might prove helpful, because i dont think youll put on your phone and take it off for bed at night.so i lent this to a 15 year old boy for two days for his opinion and he said 8220its stupid8221. then a 22 year old woman and she kind of liked it and said shed take it if i was giving it to her. hardly rave reviews, eh?so i can recommend this for communications but not music and walking, not jogging, while upright, not bending over and that means its not real useful for this guy but for you it could be. i hope this helps you in deciding an online purchase.",you need to know that i was contacted by the nice people at ontrion and asked to review this product
448,"five effective stars! the unu aero wireless rechargeable 2000mah external battery case and charger pad for iphone 5 and 5s is an excellent system, providing substantial additional power to the iphone plus it is a wireless way to recharge both the iphone and its charging case by placing it on a charging pad. after having already tested a couple of these general type chargers from competitors, this is the best iphone 55s charger, so far. the 2.6 ounce aero case unit adds one half inch in length to the iphone and consists of a nice 2 piece protective battery case which contains a 5 volt, 2 amp the aero case tag cites 500ma input5 volt, 1 amp output max 2000mah capacity reserve power rechargeable battery for the iphone from within its surrounding protective case the manufacturer claims 6 hours additional talk time and 8 hours of video playback from the case battery. on the back of the case, there is anon button and 4 blue led status lights showing charging status of the case battery itself. when both the iphone power and the case power are depleted or when a full charge is needed, the phone can simply be placed on top of the included aero wireless charging pad, which itself is connected to a power source via its micro usb to usb cable i hooked the charger pad to a standard ac wall connection via an apple usbac plug not included for faster charging.right out of the box, i easily mounted the iphone into the 2piece snugfitting case, pushed the on button, felt the iphone vibrate twice, and the case battery charged a fully powerdepleted iphone up to 43 of capacity and stopped charging at that point. then i placed the phone onto the charger pad to continue charging the iphone, and the power percentage immediate jumped from 43 to 49 and continued to charge to 100. at that point the battery case had only 2 leds of the 4 lit, so i continued the charging process until all 4 leds were lit the entire charging process for both was about 6 hours. conclusion the battery in the aero case charges after the iphone battery is fully charged, so users should continue charging the aero case to 4 light capacity. i then depleted the entire power of both the case and the iphone battery and repeated the process by stressing the charger and iphone i looped my itunes library and music played continuously for 33.2 hours. since the iphone lightning adapter port is hooked directly to the aero case power supply, access to the iphone for itunes computer syncing is through a provided cable. the manufacturer also provides a headphone extension cable because while inserting the headphone plug is no problem, removing the headphone plug could damage the cable wiring. highly recommended. 5 excellent stars! uno aero battery case, charging pad, microusb to usb charging cable, headphone extension cable, instructions on the box and a separate users manual sheet. one year limited warranty. note this item was provided directly from the manufacturer to me for an independent test and review.", note this item was provided directly from the manufacturer to me for an independent test and review.
616,"five maximized stars! and maximized is the correct word for this 15,000 mah maxboost electron plus portable battery charging monster that has so much power it can simultaneously charge 2 devices a tablet via the 5 volt, 2.1 mah usb port and a iphone5 via the 5 volt, 1.0 mah usb port, for example through its dual charging ports, plus it has an onboard lcd screen which gives an exact numeric readout of the percentage of power remaining and the active ports in use. and with the remaining power it can charge 2 iphones. the physical dimensions and weight are 5 inches by 3 inches by 1 inch, 10.9 ounces. after extensive testing and recharging, this battery charger is one of the two best large capacity device chargers among the number of electronic battery chargers i have tested in recent months, both by maxboost.during the test, the maxboost electron  charged an iphone5 in 1 hour and 54 minutes while simultaneously charging a kindle touch in 3 hrs and 50 minutes, with 67 of maxboost pulse capacity remaining, which could have charged an iphone or similar device at least three times. at the beginning of the test, the iphone 5 was up for use in 6 minutes, while the kindle touch was up for use in 18 minutes. in my universe, it charges iphones, ipods, kindle tablets, and small computers, and with its lcd screen gives the user a constant display of how much power remains during the process.in my testing, it charged at a faster rate up to the 50 point before dropping back to a more normal rate nearing the 100 level of charging a characteristic shared by both maxboost batteries. this gets the users device up and running and in the green status on the devices  meter faster than chargers i have tested which usually charge at a 1 per minute rate for example this pulse charger pushed the iphone to a 25 charge level in 20 minutes. the electron plus charger itself recharges to full capacity via the 5 volt micro usb input port in around 12 and a half hours if plugged directly into the wall and using the correct power cord using an extension cord slows down the charging speed of the maxboost pulse charger considerably. plus the maxboost pulse has a nice closein use emergency light on the side, good for hours of use. in any household with many small electronic gadgets, this would be an excellent charger that can do two devices at a time and then have capacity to charge another item. this maxboost electron plus 15000 mah dual port charger gets my highest recommendation. 5 reliable stars! maxboost electron plus portable battery, usb charging cable with micro and mini usb adapter heads, and apple 30 pin adapter head user manual and soft cloth pouch with drawstring, 1 year warranty. item provided by the manufacturer for testing and an impartial review.",item provided by the manufacturer for testing and an impartial review.
713,"five useful stars. maxboosts small, sleek, black, plastic 5600 mah electron mini charger the little brother to the two bigger maxboost chargers the maxboost pulse 10000 mah and the maxboost electron plus 15000 mah weighs in at 4.6 ounces, fits nicely in the palm of the hand, and can be slipped easily into a briefcase or a pants pocket. it has a single usb charging port, boasts and delivers the ability to charge 2 and a half iphones, one after the other, before needing to be recharged. it has the expected onboard blue led digital display window which shows the exact percentage of power available, when the usb charger port is active, and the power on the port. it also has the expected onboard led flashlight which casts a 3foot beam of light across a dark room.this little dynamic charger arrived already charged to 45 capacity so it can immediately give a charge to any usb device within its capabilities. some other dual chargers have to share power between ports, but this charger concentrates on only one port at 2.1 amps and it is fast, starting out at about 1 per minute and then increasing that rate before slowing down at the 95 of charge level. after charging the maxboost 5600 charger itself up to 100, i charged up an iphone in a quick 1 hour and 52 minutes with 63 capacity remaining in this maxboost mini 5600 mah charger, then charged the 2nd iphone with 43 charge still remaining in the maxboost, and then charged a third iphone to 54 of the phones capacity as the maxboost was finally depleted 2 and a half iphones, exactly as advertised. that initial charge of 152 is among the fastest times of the many chargers i have tested. very highly recommended. five quick stars! maxboost 5600 mah electron mini charger, microusb charging cable, user manual. 1 year warranty. this item was provided by the manufacturer for testing and an impartial review.",this item was provided by the manufacturer for testing and an impartial review.
68,"for myself, wearing my phone around my neck, just doesnt work. it sways, it bounces and it bumps into things, maybe while sitting in a chair i could use it. of course, then i could simply set my phone next to me.speaking as an electronic technician, hanging your phone by the port just seems like a bad idea and i wouldnt hang it from my headphones either. if i were to hang my phone like this, i would choosethis less expensive wayof doing it.i like using a stylus, but again, id choose another less expensive way of doing it.like thisorlike this.many probably dont remember how metal watch bands with locking clasps became popular. it was because a thief could come from behind and slide the other kind right off your wrist and run with it. an expensive phone on a silicone band seems like an offer being made to thieves in some environments.the major problem for me is that i dont like wearing my phone around my neck and ill carry it in other ways.an honest review for a product i didnt pay for.",an honest review for a product i didnt pay for.

863,"frieq leather case is made out of two tone buffalo hide with decorative leather lacings on one side.  it has look inspired by a football, but you dont have to be a football fan to appreciate the design of the case. the laces not only look good but provide extra grip for holding the case. however, if you are looking for a present for football fans this design would surely appeal to them.the outside of the case is sized 8 by 6.6. it holds the tablet by elastic bands on the corners see attached photo collage, photo 2.  th design of this folio leaves all sides of the tablet open, and so it fits not only ipad mini but any tablet of similar size.  the downside of this open design that the case does not provide protection for the corners of the tablet. the elastic bands in general holds the tablet slightly less securely than a leather folio with full enclosure.the case has a builtin stand, which works best in horizontal position. the case closes with one snap closure. the inside of the case is made from brown suede.overall, i found it to be unique and attractive looking, nice to touch, and has a feel of good quality product.i received this case for evaluation from manufacture and shared with you both the positives and the negatives of my experience with case.the photo collage referenced in the review can be located by following customer photos link under the main photo.ali julia review",i received this case for evaluation from manufacture and shared with you both the positives and the negatives of my experience with case.

844,"full disclaimer i received one of these cables for free in order to review it.hdmi cables are usually quite a pain to purchase, as you end up getting one of two things an incredibly expensive cable that is super thick, enormous, and nearly impossible to bend. an extremely thin tiny hdmi cable that ends up stripping after a weeks worth of usage.ive had both of the above happen to me in the past, and its frustrating because the last thing anyone wants to do is go shopping for wiring components.ive used this hdmi cable for 3 months now. i have a large tv monitor on my office desk, which i plug into my laptop via my hdmi cable. since im constantly pulling the cord out and putting it in i take my laptop around with me this cable ended up being a perfect match as it is solid but not too thick, and very flexible meaning i can easily move it around on my desk and brush it out of the way.in the past ive used several other types of hdmi cables which left me frustrated. the ones from best buy were extremely thick probably meant to be permanently set in walls for home theater systems or something, expensive, and inflexible. using that thing on my desk like dragging a firehose around with meit couldnt bend, knocked over papers, took up an enormous amount of space.ive also ordered some other cables on amazon which were cheap and thin, and literally fell apart at the connector end after plugging  unplugging them several times.this really is the perfect hdmi cable its cheap. its strong. its flexible. its a good size not huge and thick, not small and thin.if you really want a good hdmi cable, you should give this one a tryfor the price it cant be beat.",full disclaimer i received one of these cables for free in order to review it.
706,full disclosure  i received this product as a free sample to review.  i was in no way coerced into making a positive review.the overall design of the unit is quite pleasing.  it fits in your hand nicely as well as your pocket.  it feels sturdy and well made.  the multifunction button feels like it will last for a long time.i topped off the charge when i first opened the package and then set it to charge my htc one m7.  the phone was at about 30 when i started charging.  the phone was fully charged in about an hour and the charge left on the maxboost was showing 50.  not bad.since then i have been using it to charge my htc one and my samsung note 10.1 2014.  its been great for both.  ive used it now quite heavily for almost 3 weeks and i havent seen any degradation of the battery.  it can still charge my phone about twice on a single charge.if you are looking for a travel charger with a mini usb i very much recommend the maxboost electron mini.,full disclosure  i received this product as a free sample to review.
241,"full disclosure i received a free product in exchange for an honest review. my husband tested and reviewed the charger, since he8217s the designated household geek.the 5 star america external battery charger bills itself as the 8220thinnest  fastest charging external battery pack in the world.8221  i can8217t vouch for either of those claims, but the battery charger is indeed thin and very fast at charging a phone.  i tested it with my nexus 5 which was down to 10 battery.  after about an hour on the charger, my phone was back to 100 battery.  it8217s really only good for at most one full charge for modern smart phones, and i was unable to charge a nexus 7 with it.performance aside, 5 star america chose a colorful design and sleek lines.  the charger i tested was lime green, with a black top, and lime green usb cable.  the usb cable plugs into either a full size usb port for when you8217re charging the battery charger, and a microusb port for when you8217re charging your phone.  my only small quibble would be the lack of a wall wart, but with the many wall warts i already have, not to mention laptops with usb ports that can charge, it8217s not a problem.i would recommend a 5 star america external battery charger to anyone.  it8217s sleek, fast, and colorful, a combination rarely seen this gadget space.4.5 stars because a wall wart would be nice!, rounded up to five on amazon.",full disclosure i received a free product in exchange for an honest review.
418,"full disclosure i received a free sample of the unu aero wireless charging battery case and mat for the iphone 5s5 as part of the utry program.i have been using a mophie juice pack plus on my 5s since i got it last year and absolutely love it, and i have to say that the unu aero wireless charging battery case is everything that is good with the juice pack plus and then some. the aero contains a 2000 mah cell, which is only a bit smaller than the 2100 mah cell in the juice pack plus. the dimensions of two cases are very similar with the aero being a bit smaller and thinner. what is remarkable is how light the aero is compared to the juice pack plus 2.5 ounces to 3.14 ounce per the specs considering the similar battery capacity. i got the black aero case, which has a matted, soft rubber finish which helps with grip. theres also a glossy white version for your white iphone.installation was easy. the aero uses the sledandbumper design, so you just slip your phone onto the back of the case, then snap on the bumper. i found that its easiest to line up the power button at the top and then snap the bumper into place moving down towards the home button. overall installation only took me a couple of minutes. the case and phone can be charged using the microusb port on the bottom of the case. i was happy to see that the phone can be synced with itunes via that same microusb port, which was my one major complaint with the juice pack plus.the one really neat feature of the aero is the wireless charging capability. from the unu site the aero wireless charging system works by completing the charging circuit between the two contacts on the back of the battery case and the charging pad power source. in practice what you do is place the phone on the charging pad and it starts charging. i liked the idea of wireless charging before, but now that i have used the aero for the past few weeks i have to say that this is now a must have for me. i can just drop it down on the charging pad instead of fidgeting with the microusb cable and port to charge. its a small, simple thing, but it makes life so much easier.there are a few things to watch out for. while the sledandbumper design makes installation easy, i have to question how well it will protect the phone in a drop since the bumper comes off pretty easily. i also dont think that the wireless charge is of the qi or pma variety so you will need to get additional charging pads from unu and you wont be able to use the wireless charging spots that are going into places like starbucks. the case also cover the bottom of the phone and extends it a little bit, so you want to make sure that your headphoneheadset plug can fit through the opening  and adapter is included so this isnt a huge problem.the one thing that i would do to improve the aero is to add microsuction feet onto the charging pad to hold it in place on the table. the pad is really light and slides around a bit on my desk.so should you get the aero wireless charging battery case? if youre in the market for a battery case, i highly recommend giving the aero case a look. at 100 its less expensive than the juice pack plus 120 with about the same battery capacity and has microusb syncthrough and wireless charging. to me its the better value.",full disclosure i received a free sample of the unu aero wireless charging battery case and mat for the iphone 5s5 as part of the utry program.
267,"full disclosure i received a review version of this product in exchange for an unbiased review. the opinions below are entirely my own.first, a few things to get out of the way i was able to test this product on a few phones, and it charged all of them more rapidly than their native wall chargers, and the battery itself needed less charging than expected. so yes, it works on phones, and it works well. as for tablets and anything else, i unfortunately cannot say. its design is quite nice the consumer version, anyway, not so much the review version but the logo on the back is a bit ironic more on that shortly. its been a few weeks now and theres been no abberant charging dropoff or apparent defect, though the mini end of the cable doesnt seem to have been neatly cut. its in the rubber so its only cosmetic, but im asked to be detailed.where things fall apart is when it comes to the warranty and support. first of all, i note that the warranty does not cover many things, like accidental damage or reasonable or excessive wear and tear, leaving me to wonder  just what circumstances does it cover? i first checked the website listed in the user manual, which offers no actual information itself, but surprisingly, neither does the site. it appears to still be under construction. i then sent an email to the contact address on 1206, and it is now 1216  aside from an automated reply, i got nothing. finally, everything from the manual to the email to the website is written in rather poor english  my friend in wyoming assures me that it is not the way people speak in cheyenne, where the company purports to be.the bottom line it really is a good charger, and ill happily continue to use it  but the moment something goes wrong, im not counting on any help from the warranty.",full disclosure i received a review version of this product in exchange for an unbiased review.

272,"full disclosure on this review, i received a free sample of this battery pac from the company for review.  i tested this product every day for 2 weeks on multiple devices to get an accurate view of its performance.  i have also used the mophie juice pac and the motorola p4000 battery pac.  this is not as good as the mophie or the motorola in some ways but they sell for between 60 and 90 dollars and this 5 star america pac is 14, so you have to keep that in mind.  here goes.this pac is very light and thin, i like the design.  it charges from a computer usb port.  the cable they provide seems to be a good quality micro usb cable and i like the flat design.  it is also fairly long, i hate a short data cable.  i wish this included a wall charger like the mophie and motorola but for the price i can live without it.  the first 3 times i used this pac it did not quite fully charge a phone but after charging and draining it 3 times it seemed to build up capacity nicely and it worked well after that this is not unusual for a lot of battery powered devices in my experience.i tested this on a samsung galaxy s4, lg g2, htc one max and a motorola ultra smartphone and it charged all of them from dead to full charge in about 2 hours.  i also tried this on a samsung note 10.1 tablet and an ipad 1.  it charged the ipad 1 quickly.  the samsung tablet said it was not charging but it did charge it very slowly.  i also charged my olympus tough camera from this and ran a car gps unit off of it with no problems the gps unit is old and will no longer turn on with the internal battery.overall i think this product works very well and is well worth 14.  the other 2 pacs will charge a phone twice off of 1 charge where this will only charge a phone once.  this also doesn8217t feel quite as durable as far as outer shell material goes but how much abuse are you going to be putting this through?  for a quarter of the price of these other 2 pacs it holds up quite well.  i will be using this a lot next summer for extra power around the campfire.","full disclosure on this review, i received a free sample of this battery pac from the company for review."
690,"full disclosure, i received this product from maxboost free of charge through their vipu program. i was not told to give a positive review in return.ive had this product for a little over a week and have been using it constantly to charge my nexus 5 and 1st generation kindle fire.  the kindle will get between a 5075 charge from a full charger, i think a newer tablet would charge a lil better and more consistently. my nexus 5 will get about 1.5 full charges from the product. but that is with me still using my phone while its charging, facebook, messaging, normal stuff. i could definitely get 2 full charges if i left it alone while charging. ive also been using high drain apps  google maps, pandora, nees for speed, etcon my phone while using the product to see how it handles that. while the battery pack drains at a good clip the phone still keeps a near full charge. this came in handy at jury duty the other day and at a couple work stops where i had to wait around with no outletvto use.the product itself seems well made and sturdy. very bare bones nothing fancy about it. the screen handles its job well telling you what the charge percentage is and what your inputoutput volts are. the glossy plastic is a smudge magnet and very slippery. a matte finish would been a better design in my opinion. its a little on the bulky side for a micro charger but its really not something big plan on keeping on me all the time.before receiving this product i always say portable chargers as a novelty not worth 4050. but now ive seen how convient they can be and helpful. i think 2030 for this product is a deal if you can find it but probably not more than that.","full disclosure, i received this product from maxboost free of charge through their vipu program."

828,"hi,this is my review of the hootoo htct01 40w 4port charging station w otg usb access function.  i was provided a sample by the manufacturer to give my personal evaluation and opinion.my initial impressions7.8a total output is impressive for this current date and time of available wall chargers.  this is 2.4a for tablets, and 1.5a for smartphones.i previously evaluated the ravpower bolt that was a similar featured wall charger and it had a total output of 6.2a 2.1a for tablets, and 1a for smartphones.  they currently both have the same sales price of 19.99.  but the extra with the hootoo htct01 is that it has an otg port which is a new feature for the price range of these wall chargers. note its important to read the amazon product page and user manual before using this product.theres 2 ports labeled smart.  what that really means is that it can charge most tablets and smartphones.  my ipad air oem charger is 2.4a and this hootoo port matches the oem current output, so thats great.  the ports labeled iphone and android each take 1.5a total output.  do not let the labels fool you.  you can charge any smart phone, cell phone, or bluetooth keyboard with these ports.  i contacted hootoo support and mentioned they should change the naming convention on the wall charger labels to not confuse people.  in the end, its 2 ports that are 2.4a max and 2 ports that are 1.5a max.something nice to note is that all ports have an intelligent chipset that allows it to auto adjust the current to devices plugged in.  so for example, if you have a device that takes 1a current output and you plug it in the 1.5a port, the port will draw only 1a current to the device.  similarly, if you plug that same device to a 2.4a port, the port will draw only 1a current to the device, so you do not have to worry about it overcharging past the limits of the electronic devices.during my first test charging devices, i charged 2 cell phones, and 1 bluetooth keyboard.  i checked on them about 20 minutes later and to my surprise, holding the ct01 is comfortable.  it didn8217t feel hot like the last wall charger i evaluated.however, during my next test charging devices, i charged an ipad air, ipad 2, and two cell phones, which nearly maxed the total current output, and when i came back to check on it 20 minutes later, i felt the top and bottom of the wall charger get very hot to where it wasnt comfortable to hold and grip.  it concerned me at first, but i asked hootoo support and found out that it is recommended to let the device cool down for 1015 minutes after unplugging.  the lifeline of the device will not be shortened due to this observation of continuous usage.it is possible to charge 4 smartphones simultaneously across all 4 ports of this wall charger since they would be at or below the max current for each port.  however, it is not recommended to charge 4 tablets simultaneously as it can damage the product.  if you have more than 2 tablets at home, i suggest you buying 2 of these units to share in the family household.you can charge iphone, android, and windows phones to the 2 ports labels 34iphone34 and 34android34 interchangeably.  what matters is the 1.5a specification for those ports.a mistake that i made was that i was not aware that this products otg function is not compatible with apple devices.  it only works on android devices currently, so when i connected my ipad air using the lightning cable to the otg port and used a usb flash drive or hard drive, nothing happened when connected.  this is by current design.  i hope future models have support for apple devices.this product does have a 34short circuit, overcharge protection and surge protection34 built in to protect devices while charging.  it is not stated in the user manual, but i asked this from hootoo support and got the verification.  im glad hootoo cares about safety when designing its products.suggestions1 i think it would be better if the ports were labeled with the amps for the more technical people who understand their devices.  it makes it strange because why are the 2.4a ports labeled 8220smart8221 and the 1.5a ports8221 not also labeled 8220smart8221?it makes people unsure which port to plug in bluetooth speakers, headsets, and external battery packs.  this is not mentioned in the user manual.  i can understand a product8217s current requirement, but it may not be very universally understood for other users looking at the naming convention of the wall charger ports.2 when you first power on the wall charger, after a few seconds of plugging it into the wall, you8217ll see the led icon turn blue to indicate that it8217s on.  what would be a nicer feature is if each port had its own light that was either colored red, yellow, or green to indicate if it8217s off, passing current through and charging, or when the device has fully charged and no longer passes current through.3 i suggest a ventilation system designed for this product such as a fan or heat sink to dissipate the heat quickly and during the charge process.4 i suggest the power cord be designed to charge with a longer cord by at least 1 extra feet of distance.  i had a hard time positioning this wall charger around my desk or table from the ground where my surge protector or wall outlet was because the power cord is short.  if i leave the wall charger on the ground along with my electronics charged on the ground, then thats not a problem that is noticed.  but, if i want to use the otg or charge devices with the wall charger positioned on my office workstation table, i cannot wrap it from the back of my table and bring it forward because theres not enough cord length.5 there should be mention of other electronic devices that connect via usb for charging in the user manual, such as bluetooth keyboards, bluetooth speakers, headsets, external battery packs, and so forth.  i can understand a product8217s current requirement, but it may not be very universally

825,"hootoo 4portthis is one handy little gadget!our whole family can charge our phones, tablets, bluetooth speakers, even my ecigs on this one device anything with a usb charger.it8217s also small and can fit in a tight spot.another nice feature is that it comes with a usb to microusb cable which is handy for some devices like my donut bluetooth speaker.each port is labeled smart, iphone, android, otc which can be a bit confusing if a family has multiples of the same type of phone and think they cannot plug in their iphone into the android port. since all ports are compatible for all types of devices i am not sure why they are labeled differently. since the device controls the maximum charge current, why not make them all the same output for more flexibility of use?the otc is a great feature but it is not compatible with our apple products.hoottoo is also an excellent company with great attentive customer service.i received this product for testing and review purposes but all opinions are solely my own.",received this product for testing and review purposes but all opinions

583,"how does this compare with the 10000 mah pulse charger from maxboost? well, its 15000 mah, so of course its a third more power. the size is a bit bigger, but not that much. it is heavier, as youd expect, but solidly made. both the pulse and this new electron plus have very similar features, and are easy to use. the price is higher for the pulse, but if you compare the cost for a 10000 vs. 15000 mah charger, its adjusted accordingly. you may want more of a backup than the smaller charge gives for heavier use and recharging.now that many newer android smartphones follow the iphone route and close off a battery compartment, external chargers appear to be gaining in necessity. this maxboost 15000 mah dualport 3a premium usb portable external battery differs from other chargers, in my experience, five ways.1 its heftier. near a pound, perhaps. its more rugged, on the other hand, as a tradeoff. likely too heavy for a pocket, but in a pouch, backpack or luggage, a better fit.2 its readable. the blue led as the product description displays above makes this more precise in its readout in bigger black letters on a brighter blue background. this allows more precision as to estimating the claim is to 1 how much or how little of a charge is needed.3 its laid out thoughtfully. the added flashlight button is easily turned on and 34off34 needs as the helpful instructions remind you, just an added push for a short time as an added bonus. its easy to hold in the hand with its curved shape rather than a brick like other chargers, and so it fits well into the palm.4 miniusb and an applecompatible plug are provided as options and a small case is also sent along, a thoughtful touch. finally, the dual ports for 2.1 tablet or 1 phone are engraved with their respective entries. this may be harder to make out in the dark as its black on black, but it does not wear away easily.5 the box for the electron in its list of items it can charge updates some of the newer smartphones and devices but its compatible with pretty much the gamut of phones, tablets, mp3 players, and ipods and ipadsand even google glass. i note from comments on the pulse that maxboost is attentive to customer feedback and if its products are faulty, they take pains to correct faults and to replace what has been sold, and this to me indicates a responsive company to support. i was sent this to evaluate fairly.",i was sent this to evaluate fairly.

712,i am a part of the vipu program and received this maxboost electron mini 5600mah battery pack for free as a sample. when it arrived it was fully charged to 100 that told me that i can hold a charge when in not using it. i like that it is light weight and easy to read. i used it on my iphone 5s where i have a battery of 87 left. it charged it really fast. when i charged the battery at about 12 it took about 30 minutes to charge with 69 on the battery pack. i think that was still good because i could still do everything that i needed to to while my phone charged. every other battery charger that i have had blinking lights and you couldnt tell when it was going dead or the percentage that was left.it has one usb port so you have to charge one thing at a time. i like the blue lcd light its very good for my eyes. i look at a computer screen alot and when i looked over at the light it my eyes dont get that blurry affect and have to readjust which is great. when the back light is off the numbers are still as bold as if the light was on for you to read when your charging. it also comes with a flashlight. its bright! i like that if its dark and i have to find something and this is near by i can use it without turning on the over light. this will coming in handy when you lights go out or need to find something in a dark place. when you click the button to turn on the light it also shows how much battery percentage you have left.overall i love this battery pack i would recommend it to someone who needs extra battery life on the go or just wants to recharge.,i am a part of the vipu program and received this maxboost electron mini 5600mah battery pack for free as a sample.
430,"i am a power user of my iphone, i will drain my battery often though out the day.  i have found that battery cases are a must for a power user like me.  when it comes to battery cases, i know what is important.  i own both unu battery iphone 5s cases, i will tell you why i think the aero series is the way to go over the dx case. i will also tell you about the things i that are a little less than desirable.if you have ever used a micro usb connector, you know how difficult they are to plug in.  charging your phone by putting it down on your nightstand is so convenient, so much so that i am considering a 2nd charging station for work.  however at 24.99  shipping, i think i might put that idea on hold.  the case is by far the slimmest battery cases i have owned.  it has a nice finish and slips in and out of my pocked easily.  the unu dx case does not cover the buttons and in fact makes the buttons hard to operate.  this is not a problem for the aero case.  i am glad the improved that.  taking the phone out of the case is not as easy with the aero, but you dont need to take it out that often, unless you need access to the headphone jack.  which leads me to the number one item that unu needs to fix.  the pass though cable they provide works, but it fells like you are going to break it when you try to unplug it.  also, you always have to have it with you, which is a pain.  they need a simple extension system built into the case.  i blame apple for moving it to bottom of the phone.  it has been a problem since they moved it for me.i was a previous unu customer and their customer service is great.  my dx case stopped working and they quickly sent me a brand new replacement.  i then discovered their utry program.  i was anxious to try the aero case and they were happy to supply me with a free one to review.",  i was anxious to try the aero case and they were happy to supply me with a free one to review.

694,i am going to give my honest opinion even though i got this for free..  i had it in my backpack in the car for a couple of weeks and finally got a chance to use it.  i must say i love this battery pack!!  charged my iphone 5s in 20 minutes from 6 to 100 and the battery pack still has 50 left if i needed it for something else!  to top it all off it has a flash light.  nice when you cant find the keyhole at night in the dark.  its not very big and doesnt weigh much.  the color is really nice shiny black with a easy to read led screen.  this is going to come in very handy when i go on road trips.  definitely worth buying even as a gift.  it feels sturdy compared to some of the other battery packs i have seen and looked at buying.  i would recommend this to my friends.,i am going to give my honest opinion even though i got this for free.
443,i am huge fan of unu products and their awesome customer service. this item is very cool. you put your phone in the case and then when you want to charge it you drop it on the included metal magnetic plate. it starts charging the battery and the phone. once my wife saw it she grabbed it and says she could not live without it. she hates the wires and with this you simply drop and charge. what is nice is it also has a micro usb just incase and also for a car charger. our test unit died about 5 months into daily use. my wife is hard on phone cases so we take some of the blame. unu though has awesome customer service and promptly issues an rma and a prepaid shipping label  you got to love that. thanks unu note unu provided me a free sample in exchange for an honest review., thanks unu note unu provided me a free sample in exchange for an honest review.
877,"i am not a big fan of sleeve cases, but this one by frieq really impressed me. what makes a sleeve case so awesome is that your device shows off its original design and it doesnt have a hard case or rubber case on it. most sleeve cases are just dull and dont offer much except for the protection when not using it, but this case is different. i am impressed by the features that this case offers! the sleeve its self is made of nice material and the outside is water resistant! once you unzip the case the inside is made of the color that you chose to get, either blue, pink, or grey. it offers a lot of protection with the bubbles that are on the inside, its a bit like bubble wrap but with a lot of color and a nice look to it. i really liked how you can use this sleeve as a stand, it allows for both portrait and landscape position and this is one of the best reasons why i like this case. it not only allows me to use it for protection but also for a stand when watching a movie or simply leaving your tablet to play music. this case isnt designed solely for 1 device, it is for the ipad mini, nexus 7, and the kindle fire however, it might be usable with other tablets of similar sizes. it even has a pocket in the front in which i managed to fit my iphone, so overall there really isnt much more to ask for. this is a really nice sleeve case that i rate 5 stars out of 5 stars and would highly recommend it if you want to have protection for your tablet while showing off the original design of your device.i hope this review helped you out!i was provided a sample for reviewing purposes.",provided a sample for reviewi

773,"i am not going to repeat the other reviews before me because they cover the basics of this charger very well. like them i obtained mine as a review sample.my first impression was it was just another charger in a sea of them. however, the more i used it and i thoroughly test anything before posting a review the more i was impressed. it seemed faster than most other chargers that i have used with the same basic 2.1 and 1.0 amp port ratings. i tested two apple devices ipad 2 and iphone 5s and two androids samsung galaxy note 3 and samsung tab 3 10.1. i purposely charged the phones in the 2.1 amp ports and the tablets in the 1.0 amp ones and even at 70 remaining capacity for the tablets when i plugged them in none took over three hours to charge up to 100.these do not overheat either. the specs do not say so, but i am betting that crammed into the approximately two square inch form factor are over charging and over heating protections. and its the form factor that truly impressed me. this may not have a gang of ports or a lot of bells and whistles some of the newer chargers have, but it is tiny. combine that with the charging times that i observed and it is a value for those who spend most of their time living out of suit cases. those folks tend to travel light and most need no more than the two ports this charger provides. i know because i spent a lot of my career traveling and less is more when you do that.do note that while this works with the modern samsung tablets like my tab 3 10.1, it will not work with older galaxy tab models.  other than that, if you are constantly on the road and pack efficiently this is a great charger. if you want something for the home or office you may want to consider other models with more ports and capacity.","obtained mine as a review sample.my first impression was it was just another charger in a sea of them. however, the more i used it and i thoroughly test anything before posting a review "

755,"i bought their original bike mount, which is kind of an armored vehicle for your iphone huge plastic case, thick rubber liner inside, big snaps to hold it shut, and a screwlatch mechanism to secure it to the bike mount. it worked and i never had any worries about my phone, but it was also large and unwieldy. one of the main reasons i take my phone is to snap pictures on the ride. the old mount gave you two choices unscrewunlatch and shoot through the cases plastic window or unsnap the cover latches, take iphone out and shoot. after a while you just quit taking photos...so when they offered to send a review unit i jumped at the chance. this mount is _totally_ different. first off it uses a quick mount mechanism, much like garmin has on their bike gpss, with the addition of an extra safety latch. the case is a thin, light plastic shell that your phone snaps into it takes a bit of work to get it back out that then snaps onto the handlebar mount with a quarter turn. you can use it just like this on a sunny day where you dont expect to hit any puddles or see any rain. it takes a couple seconds to unclip it from the handlebar mount and take a photo ... theres no plastic window covering the lens and flash. the case is thin enough that you can still slip your iphone into a jeans pocket.also included is a clear, rubberish weather cover. snap it over the top of the iphonecase and now the top of the unit along with the side ports are all protected from rain and splashing. due to the nature of something being over your screen it does take a bit firmer touches to register on the phone. since i mostly mountain bike im more inclined to use this cover all of the time, just for the extra screen protection, not only from water but from me going otb and the bike following.where the old case could be submerged for a while in water this one doesnt make any claims like that. frankly i wouldnt want to try it with either.pros slim, light mounting case water protection sleeve quick to mountunmount holds phone securecons protection sleeve makes it a bit harder to use touch screeni am a past bike2power customer. this product was provided to me free of charge in exchange for my honest review.", this product was provided to me free of charge in exchange for my honest review.
364,"i can only think of a few reason how you ended up here looking at the unu aero wireless charger and case and i will tell you if this casechargerexternal battery is for you or not. i will list the possible reasons belowyou are on the road a lot and do not have access to a charger to keep your iphone charged the whole day.you are a moderate to high user who depends on their mobile phone to manage their daily lives.you need something that is durable, light, easy to hold in your hands and stylishwell, as stylish as a case with a built in baqttery charger can be.need a case that will help you achieve number 1, 2, 3 with the lease amount of bulk.inexpensive, yet high in quality nd with a good warranty.i will not waste your time and recite the specs but i will tell you why this case is the best case in its line of cases. i was lucky enough to be selected to review this case for free and i chose to go with the white color and it is fantasic. it fits the iphone 5 like a glove, assuming you do not have a skin installed onto your device however if you have a skin like me, it is still effective and fits well. i have used this case for 1 week and my wife has used it for 1 weekactually she wont give it back to me now becuse she loves the case. unlike the overpriced morphies you see in every electronic store this case is only offered on amazon and myunu.com.during my 1week trial of this case i found that this case is extremely well built, egronomic, simplicity, and the idea of putting your phone on a charging pad and it starts to charge both the phone and the battery was extremely convienient and intriguing. i have not seen a similar product under 100 that gave me the performance this casebatterycharger provided me. i am a heavy user especially data, my job requires answering customer calls, surfing the web, sending and receiving emails so i use roughly between 510gb of data a month and 90 of it is because i use the personal hotspot feature in the iphone 5 to provide wifi for my ipad which is what i use to do my research, respond to emails etc., and most of you who may relate knows tethering via bluetooth consumes your battery within a matter of a few hours. after i charged the phone and the case i went about my day and when i was down to 20 i pushed a tiny button on the backbarely noticeable and then the phone starts to recharge and generally within 2030mins the phone was at 100 and automatically stops charging and the led indicators4 of them only showed 2 were used up during the process. keep in mind that the recharge process is never always the same as it depends on the conditions at that time, whether its under use, bad reception, how many apps you are running in the background etc, so please do not hang me if your phone doesnt charge in that timeframe. there were 2 really unique qualities in this charger that i was impressed with are that the battery never got warm durning the charging process, the reception wasnt affected, and last but not least, the case is built so that when you are playing your music or using the speaker featurethe sound is amplified about 30 louder than without the case. i do not know if this was intentional or not but we all know how all mobile phones lack the sound quality when playing music. when comparing apples to apples, this casecasewireless charger is in a class of its own.naturally the case is not 34perfect34 so there are some minor downfalls that i did not like about the case and theyre just personal preference so please dont keep yourself from buying the case because of these minor details that may be fixed at any time. i would have liked it more if there was an option for some sort of a leather case or holster built for it.now, since my wife has taken this case over and the wife always wins i might have to purchase one myself. i will recommend this to any business name, student, or anyone on the go because this charger will last you at least 2 days with heavy usage and the case itself is built so well i am 100 confident this case will last me a long, long time. i gave up my morphie that ive been using for over 3 yrs now and not once have i looked back.thank you for taking the time to read my review, if you like it please give a thumbs up and please let me know what you think.oh just to make sure i complete the task, i have to say that i was gifted this case for free!!!", i was lucky enough to be selected to review this case for free and i chose to go with the white color and it is fantasic.

229,"i did a double take the first time i saw the 5 star america 3100mah battery charger. it looks just like a smartphone. but appearances can be deceiving, since its really a very thin, lightweight portable battery charger. its different from other portable battery chargers in almost every way at less than a third of an inch thick, its as thin as any charger ive seen also thinner than any smartphone ive seen, and there are no buttons or other external controls. the product details indicate that the weight of the charger is 1.1 ounces, but on my postal scales, it looks like the weight is just under 3 ounces. even at that, its as light as any charger ive seen.the charger includes a 4034 usb charging cable with a microusb plug on one end and a standard type a plug on the other. the charger can be recharged from a usb port or from an ac wall charger or vehicle charger. i charged it up with a 5v1.0a wall charger, then used it to top off the charge on my samsung android phone. there was enough capacity remaining to boost the charge on my kindle fire hd 734 tablet. with a full charge, the battery charger should have enough capacity to completely recharge any cellphone on the market today, or extend the usable time of any tablet at least a few hours. its all automatic too there are no buttons to fiddle with. when the charger is plugged into a mobile device, recharging begins immediately and shuts off when the mobile device has been recharged to 100 or when the charger is depleted, whichever occurs first.heavy duty users of smartphones and tablets who are away from recharging sources for much of the day will likely need more recharging capacity than this charger has. for many users, however, 3100mah will be sufficient for their needs, and the small size and weight of the charger will be welcomed. and i have to give kudos to the manufacturer for mentioning that battery chargers have energy losses that reduce the effective capacity by up to 30 of the advertised capacity. most manufacturers dont mention that fact. 5 star america claims that their battery charger has an energy conversion rate of 85, which would yield an actual effective capacity of 2600mah.a product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.",a product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.
532,"i did get this from maxboost vipu program and yes, this was a sample i did in fact receive this for free. first off the charger was by far the best charger you will ever buy. it works extremely well, it come with a built in flashlight.also it lights up blue to indicate that it is charging your phone. and also whats good about this is that it always shows the battery percent of how much percent is left on the charger. to let you know when you charge it it takes about a good 810 hours just to fully charge to 100 thats the only downside but, on the other hand it last for about 46 hours. it is a really good thing to buy for travel. i would recommend this product to anyone i see.","i did get this from maxboost vipu program and yes, this was a sample i did in fact receive this for free."

649,"i got a free sample to review, but this review is totallee heheh honest.so far, the only case i have truly loved is therearth ringke slim. it was slim and very light almost like a naked iphone. however, this case is almost on par with that one for me. its not as slim and minimalistic, which i prefer, but its very light and offers good protection. while i like the minimalist look of the iphone, this is one doesnt look bad at all to me. i enjoy using it. it comes in rather attractive colors. what more would you want? for about 7, you get a pretty good deal.my only problem with it is the camera cutout. it does not affect performance, but it just doesnt look right. this is purely personal preference and your view might vary, but the hole seems a teeny bit small. i just think it would look better if it was slightly larger and maybe cut out in the totalleeslim skinshape.","i got a free sample to review, but this review is totallee heheh honest."

805,"i had a chance to test the review sample of this speaker sidebyside of two others that i had set up. all three had something going for them that the others didnt. for this it was sound quality.this has the perfect combination of volume and frequency response. i am especially impressed with the low end response. i almost exclusively listen to jazz, but the bass on this speaker was so deep that i tested it withled zeppelin, and especially john paul jones bass on dazed and confused. that sold me. not that i regularly pull out my rock albums, but i knew that the speakers were great. of course my normal test album, miles daviskind of blue, was superbly reproduced with a nicely balanced highs, mids and lows.operation is simple. after you switch it on, press the button with the bluetooth logo, scan from your device, pair and connect. i would have preferred the more modern way where you turn the speaker on, scan and connect, but having a dedicated bluetooth button is just as good in my opinion. anything is better than the old style multifunction button method.one thing that i love about this speaker is it has front and rear speakers, which i am guessing accounts for the rich sound. when i was testing mine it sounded like there was a crossover circuit because of the bass separation on some tracks, but i cannot be absolutely positive because the speakers are pretty close together.of course the price is a great feature too. this is one of the less expensive speakers i have owned, but one of the best sounding ones. no frills, but darn good sound  and easy to operate if this will be your first bluetooth speaker.",i had a chance to test the review sample of this speaker sidebyside of two others that i had set up

801,"i have a couple of portable bluetooth wireless speakers, but as my computer does not read most bluetooth devices, oddly, despite efforts to upgrade the driver, i use a speaker for musical enhancement. like others, this can also be used with a miniplug provided along with usbtomini charger cable, both very short wires. so, it delivers a respectable sound, not audiophile, but as its bigger than the collapsible pocketsized versions, better than those for a sound audible across a room. it lacks a bass control or much of a setting the cube buttons are onoff, phone, volume updown, and bluetooth. two plugs at the back, and an indicator light, red for charging and green when charged. booklet instructions are clearly written and easy to read.an advantage is the cube design. a speaker is front facing, opposite the plugs the sides are solid. its a fun piece to look at and hold. a grip is glued on the bottom of this handy unit, and its weighty enough not to easily tip over or be dragged on a surface, too.one limit is the fact when the audio plug is in that the unit cannot be altered by volume. only the master unit device controls this. also, when charging it says about 46 hours a charge and it takes about 1.5 hours from the start to charge itself, the unit cannot be used, somewhat of an obstacle if you want to use it while charging itsorry. but, with bluetooth, more freedom is possible...p.s. i was asked to test this for review.", i was asked to test this for review.
155,"i have a droid 4 that is seemingly always low on battery power  or worse.  it charges all evening but by the time i just get through my morning emails and messages its already weak. by midday im lucky if it has any power remaining, at all. i cannot afford to be tethered all the time, especially when im in the vehicle and need to use my phone.  the irony is when i get to my destination, it could often be tethered but then i often dont have access to an electrical outlet.in steps the utechsmart 10,000 mah battery pack! when im in my vehicle or at home, the utechsmart gets recharged from my cell phone charger.  when im out and about i store it in my purse or in my carry all bag, tethered to my droid.  what a great winwin solution!also, when we have those crazy power outages, i found a usb lamp that i have plugged into this battery pack  it stayed lit through a several hour power outage.  the light was bright enough with this battery pack i was able to read a book so i could finish a book review! i now intend to get several more external battery packs and usb lamps i tested the satechi lamp with this battery pack so when those winter ice storms or spring thunderstorms knock out the power, i still have some light. with this 10,000 mah external battery pack, the lamp stayed lit for the whole duration of the power outage several hours.note  this battery pack was supplied for reviewing purposes. after an honest trial of this battery pack over a couple months, i am thoroughly satisfied this battery pack is a great quality product!update jan 2014  the utechsmart 10,000 mah external battery pack is still going strong and has saved me a number of times. i simply charge it in the vehicle on a spare charger and its always ready to go when i need it plus its conveniently with me at all relevant times.",this battery pack was supplied for reviewing purposes.
386,"i have always been a fan of iphone battery cases since they started coming out for the iphone 4. recently i went on a search for a good iphone 5s battery case. lo and behold! i was able to get my hands on this unu aero case via a free sample directly from unu. in the past i have used mophie, maxboost, and tgp, so i was excited to test another case to see how it stacks up.i received the package two weeks ago and i have been testing the case ever since. the first thing i noticed was the unu packaging. it is definitely packed professionally with good descriptions and explanations of the product on the box as well as having pleasing illustrations.upon opening the package, the items i received were the case, a bumper pad, micro usb charging cable, a charging mat, and a headphone extension. the assembly of the case was fairly simple as the phone slides directly over the lightning adapter of the case and the bumper pad snaps on to the case. i attached the bumper pad starting at the top of the case. i really like the bumper pad as it has a lock button on the top of the bumper and a volume button cover which keeps you from having to reach into the slot to change the volume.now for the case itself. the case is a nice size. its pretty slim, does have a little weight to it, but thats to be expected with a battery case. there are two ways to charge the case. 1. the micro usb charging cable and 2. the charging mat. for me the best use of the charging mat is having is set up on my nightstand so that when i go to bed at night i can just lay the case right on the mat and i have easy access to it. not having to plug the case into a cable is pretty cool but its also nice to have the option when needed.the battery capacity seems to be really great! i have been using the case for over two weeks and i will allow my phone to get down to 20 before pushing the button on the back of the case to charge the battery. every time it will charge my phone to 100 and i still have decent power left over. the power meter on the back is a nice touch as well. i have not found myself in a situation to really have to plug my phone in to charge since i started using this case. by the time i go to bed my phone still has power and then i put the case on the mat and fully charged for the next day along with my unu battery case to back it up.personally, out of the battery cases i have used in the past, this one is my favorite. it seems to have the best battery life and the charging mat is a very cool feature. you can expand your options as well buy purchasing more of the mats for 20 each. i did have one negative thing happen with the phone. the bumper pad volume button cracked somehow. however, when i reported it to unu they promptly sent me out a new bumper pad to replace it. the customer service and communication was great.the reason i give the case 4 stars is the price point. i would like to see this combo price in at around 80 instead of 100. that being said, this is an excellent case and i will be quick to use unu products in the future.",i was able to get my hands on this unu aero case via a free sample directly from unu.i received the package two weeks ago and i have been testing the case ever since.

369,"i have been an iphone user since the second generation iphone 3g was released.  as much as i have enjoyed each unit, the one issue has been that battery life has been only barely acceptable.  i use my phone all day for both work and personal reasons.  i am constantly answering emails, taking and making phone calls, etc., plus i am a bike rider that likes to have my phone running the entire time i ride for music, route tracking, gps, etc.  suffice it to say that i am a battery draining maverick!i have tried a number of external battery devices, and reviewed a few.  i had previously reviewed one of the nonwireless unu cases with good results, so was pleased to be offered this aero wireless unit for free to review as well.  it is important to note that even though i received this unit for free that unu has not attempted to influence my review at all.  here is my honest experience with this devicefunctionality 8211 functionally this is a hard case to beat!  i have tested it in a number of scenarios, and it has yet to fail me.  using it as a standalone device works well.  no issues using it with bluetooth.  no issues with sound quality when using it to play music via internal speaker.  no issues plugging it into my car audio system.  no issues using phone functions.  bottom line 8211 no issues at all where this case affects the basic functional use of my iphone 5.  it does add size to the phone discussed more later, but i have adopted to that just fine.quality 8211 very impressive quality.  this case is tough, attractive, and protects my phone well.  i like the matte finish, no fingerprints, does not show small scratches, etc.  i am confident that my phone is safe.battery life  wireless charging! 8211 this is what you buy a case like this for, and i can reliably say that i have gotten great use out of the additional battery life.  on a normal day without the case, i am pretty much dead by 6 pm or so.  with this case, i am good to go for a couple days easy.  the extra charge itself will get me at least 100 additional life, but wait 8211 there is that wireless charging bonus thing!  on a typical workday, i sit at my desk for 46 hours.  without this wireless capability, i would 34sometimes34 plug my phone in on my desk so i could keep my charge up, but having to plus and unplug is a pain.  with this case, all i have to do is lay my phone on the charging pad!  when i need my phone i grab and go and do not have to worry about plugging, unplugging, etc.  when my phone rings 8211 i pick it up and answer it.  when i need to send a text 8211 i pick it up and send it.  it8217s hard to describe just how much nicer the wireless charging really is.  i bought an additional charging pad to put beside my bed as well.  when i go home, i just lay it on that pad and forget it.  if the phone rings i am not fumbling to unplug and answer it 8211 you just pick it up and put it back down when done.  this wireless charging works.  charges quickly too.  your phone works as normal all day, then when you need a charge you just press the button on the back and it juices you up 8211 no problem.  i have also had a couple friends who were just about juiced out and i was able to lend them my case for a half hour or so and send them on their way happy!  nice to have that capability as well. i have not run out of juice even once since i have had this case.  i8217m not foraging about at the airport looking for a plug, or having to cut my music off while on a bike ride to save power.  as i said 8211 my 8220ilife8221 has gotten better!no device is perfect, but my concerns are minimal.  the size and heft this case adds to my iphone is not something i like 8211 but i tolerate it easily as a tradeoff for all the advantages, one of which is the sturdy protective nature of it.  reality though is that with battery technology being where it is today, i am not sure how they could have made it much smaller.  the accessibility of the headphone jack has been an issue a couple of times as well when i did not have the little extension cable they include for free, so had to take the case off to get to the jack.  i am also not a fan of the fact that they chose to use the micro usb cable, i would have preferred just a personal choice they used a lightning connection.  there have been a few times when i needed to connect up to an audio system or charging cable and would have just liked to have the apple connection, but it is not a big deal, i just make sure i have a micro usb, which i know is probably more common nowadays.  note though that if you want to use any kind of apple connected device you will have to remove the phone from the case to do so.  all this combined causes me to drop my rating one star, but i would rather it was just a half!  i buy a ton of gadgets each year, and put them though their paces.  this one does what it says it does and does it well.  i highly recommend this case.","  i had previously reviewed one of the nonwireless unu cases with good results, so was pleased to be offered this aero wireless unit for free to review as well."

920,"i have been using the aleratec isx1 speaker with an iphone 5 for just listening to music, and i will say right up front that i like the product.mine arrived in a nice clear plastic box with a cardboard inner base with the graphics on it.  in the bottom of that inner base were the two cords that the speaker uses and a very small instruction sheet.  one of the cables is a coiled headphone style cable, the other is a headphone style cable that also has a usb plug on one end.  the coiled cable is used for listening to the speaker, and the cable with the usb plug on it is used for charging the device.when i plug the speaker into a computer to charge it, i hear a very slight hum out of the speaker.  i know that its on and charging this way, and i dont find it to be really noticeable as long as there is anything else going on in the room, including just my computer running.  if i had it plugged into a wall adapter in a silent room, im sure it would be more noticeable, but the way im charging it i simply dont notice the hum.when you plug a cable into the speaker, a very faint green light appears near the input on the speaker itself.  this green light goes on whether you have the usb style plug hooked up or just the headphone cable, so i believe this light just means that the speaker is 34on.34  the included manual doesnt mention anything about any lights, so im not sure if you are really even supposed to be able to see this light...but if you look, you can see it.  ive noticed on my speaker that at times there is also a red light that is visible on the opposite side of the plug input from the green light.  i believe this to be a light that indicates that the speaker is fully charged, but again, this isnt mentioned in the manual so im not 100 sure thats what its for.  the lights are so hard to see, and they are blocked by the cable when its plugged in, so i cant help but believe that youre just not really supposed to see them.what the manual does say about charging is that you should allow 48 hours of charging time before the first use.  this makes me think even more that the lights are visible but they werent originally intended to be an indicator of the state of charge.  this can make charging into some guesswork, but its not really that big of a deal.  plug it in when its dead and unplug it when you wake up in the morning, and youre good to go.the speaker has a nice suction cup base that allows it to be stuck to flat surfaces.  in my experience, the suction cup works really well.  i was able to stick it to any nonporous surface and have it stay there until i took it off, which is equally easy by just pulling on the tab on the side of the suction cup.just to see what the whole thing was all about, i pried mine out of the rubber housing.  the speaker is just a small ball with the plug input and a small pole on the bottom that helps the suction cup base stay more rigid.  it was easy enough to get out, and easy enough to get back in.  however, theres really no reason to pull it out of its base, so dont worry about how easy it is to get in or out.the thing that i liked the most about the speaker is the sound.  its not a whole lot louder than the speaker in my iphone, and it does get a bit distorted when i turn the volume all the way up but then, so do my nice headphones, so thats more on the iphones end than any speakers end, but what it does is just sound a lot 34fuller34 than the built in speaker.  i hope that makes sense.  theres a bit more bass, a bit more mid range, and the highs just sound less 34tinny.34  sure, it doesnt sound as good as a nice high end surround sound system or car stereo, but it certainly sounds about as good as i could hope a small pod speaker could sound all on its own.  i was listening to it when my wife came into the room, and even she mentioned how good the music sounded and asked what it was that i was using...and shes the type of person that literally doesnt care what stuff sounds like.  so, if it can manage to impress her, then i believe it should be able to impress just about anyone.  different genres of music all sounded better than they do on just the phones speaker, and i really enjoyed listening to the speaker with my library of music.the small coiled speaker cable is great at staying out of the way, as well.  you dont have to worry about getting it tangled up on anything.  my main way of using it was to stand my iphone up on its side, stick the speaker to the top of my computer, and then use the speaker as a bit of a stand for my iphone.  worked like a charm!!!other users have mentioned that the speaker cable requires some 34work34 to get it so that its not giving any static in the music playback, however, try as i might i could not get the speaker to give me any static.  im not sure if the manufacturer has upgraded the cable or i just had good luck, but i was pleased with how well the cable worked.in closing, i really like this little speaker.  it sounds really good for its size, which i believe is about the most important aspect of a speaker.  its suction cup feature is a nice addition.  the only downside to the speaker is the fact that its a bit difficult to tell if its fully charged, charging, or what.  i know you can see that light, but again im not sure if thats intended or just kind of an accident.  if it is intended, it should be documented on the manual sheet, and if its not, then they should take advantage of that and put an led on the outside of the speaker for you to be able to tell what exactly the speaker is doing.  this confusion regarding the charging is the only thing holding this product back from a full five star rating from me.full disclosurei was sent a unit for testing by the manufacturer, however, my opinion and rating were not rewarded or compensated in any way.","full disclosurei was sent a unit for testing by the manufacturer, however, my opinion and rating were not

400,i have been using the unu aero series case and charger for a couple weeks now. i have used other unu power cases in the past and was excited to try this one. this case is very sleek and very light. the charging base is also sleek and does not take a lot of space in my charging area at home. it is extremely easy to charge since you just need to place it on the base and walk away. this is by far the lightest charging case that i own. the case itself has a nice feel to it. the one issue i had and the reason for 4 instead of five stars is that snapping it together once my phone was in it did not feel tight enough for me. this may just be a feeling because i never once had the case come apart or my phone pop out. this case holds a slightly smaller charge than the other unu case i own so i can only get one full charge out of it and then i need to charge it again. i am assuming this is why it is so much lighter than the other case. i am fine with just the one charge and appreciate the lightness of this case. overall compared to other cases out there for my 5s unu is the first place i now look to for power options.i did recieve this case for free from unu in the utry program but the review and opinions in this review are my own.,i did recieve this case for free from unu in the utry program but the review and opinions in this review are my own.
510,"i have been using these headphones for the past week and have experienced great results overall. please note that i was provided with a free copy of this item in exchange for a fair and honest review.ease of operationthese headphones are easy to set up and use if you take the time to read through the manual. the manual will clearly walk you through how to pair the device and operate all of the different functions. there are only 3 buttons on these headphones, so each button has to be able to perform multiple tasks.the volume control buttons work perfectly, but are hard to operate by feel alone. the three buttons on the control panel volume up, volume down, and power are marked by raised symbols that do not feel very different from each other. this makes it hard for me to confidently switch between songs without looking at the buttons.build qualityim very impressed with the build quality of this product. the earbuds looked rather large to me at first but i expected that from a pair of bluetooth headphones.the earbuds are made of plastic and are incredibly light which makes them very comfortable to wear for hours at a time. the flat tanglefree cord is a nice touch, too.fitthese headphones come with two styles of ear tips in 3 different sizes  or 6 sets total. it took me a few minutes to go through and test them all, but now i eventually found a combination that fits my ears perfectly. a good fit will not only make for more comfortable listening, but can also improve the sound quality! see belowsound qualitythe sound quality is good, but not great. i had better results after trying a variety of ear tips and stabilizers to get the best possible fit for my ear. most of the tips did not fit my ear properly, which made my music sound flat with minimal bass. once i found the pair that fit me best the sound quality improved immensely! overall, the sound quality that this pair provides is decent at this price point.bluetooth connectionthe headphones pair quickly to all of my devices via bluetooth. ive tested them with multiple devices including my macbook pro, ipad, and iphone  all with great results! the headphones connect to paired devices almost instantly after i turn them on. the bluetooth range seems greater than other bluetooth products that i have used... i can leave my phone anywhere in the same room and walk around and still maintain a flawless connection.battery lifethe battery life for this product is advertised on the amazon page as being capable of providing 7 hours of continuous play time. however, the manual that comes with the headphones states that the battery is only capable of up to 4 hours of continuous play time. ive had a hard time determining my average battery cycle, but id say its definitely closer to 4 hours than 7 hours.", please note that i was provided with a free copy of this item in exchange for a fair and honest review.
249,"i have been using this charger for about a month now and i really like it. besides the fact that it is lime green i dont really like the color green, it has worked for me as advertised. the battery pack is very very thin, it is the height and width of my iphone 4s and a little less in depth. the back of the battery pack is a solid color with the logo of the company my review copy has a lot of writing on it. the other side is fingerprintmagnetglossy black. why they decided this was a good idea, i do not know. i usually draw smiley faces on the glossy side. it basically looks like a phone. but, the black glossy side does nothing. it does not turn on, does not display battery charge, it is just a piece of plastic. it has two ports, a usb port and a micro usb port. it comes with a micro usb  usb cable the same color as the battery pack.i have used this battery to charge my ipad and iphone. it gives my iphone charge and a half. i can charge my phone from 0 to 100 and still have charge left over.this is great for emergencies, to have in the car although it does lose its charge over time, in your purse it is small! and in the office. it is a great item. at the price range, this is a strong buy.note as other reviewers, i have to comment about the logo. i do find it a bit misleading. the company 5 star america has in its logo the us flag and designed for america but this is made in china. not much information is available about the company, even in their website.i was sent this complimentary item by the manufacturerseller for the purpose of a review.",i was sent this complimentary item by the manufacturerseller for the purpose of a review.
471,"i have been using this product for a couple of weeks.the battery and wireless charging work great. i really like being able to charge my phone wirelessly. it quickly charges the phone. i typically dont let my battery get less than 50 . this wireless charging system seems to charge the phone in about an hour.when i first used it, it seemed fine. but after about five times of removing the case, the plastic tabs that hold the bumper to the back of the case wears out and do not hold the case together. so if youre holding this case by the edges and you go to press on the front face of the phone, the phone drops out of the bumper part of the case. this is the opposite of protecting a phone.i have contacted unu about this a couple of weeks ago, but have not heard anything back from them.my current resolution is to put duck tape on the case to hold it together. it seems to be working.edit update unu got back to me, but not through my attempts to contact them, but by commenting on this review. shortly after writing my initial review and being contacted by unu, they did ship me out a new unit immediately. its been two weeks since i received my replacement case and ive been using it. the new unit seems to hold together a lot better, but i still am not going to chance removing it from the case. ill just leave it in the case so i dont wear out the small plastic tabs that hold it in place.  it could be that my initial one was defective though. i appreciated that unu did contact and send me a replacement part. they might want to check into their support contact form on their website to make sure its working, because after two attempts in two weeks, i never heard from them which is what prompted me to write this review. i am going to guess that the first case was defective and am changing my review from 2 stars to 4 stars.edit update 2 6262014. i really want to like this charger case. while i have kept the case on now and havent suffered from the first problem of having the case fall off after they sent me a replacement, it is with great sadness that i must say that after, about three months, the plastic piece that covers the button the top fell off and i now cant press that button anymore unless i take the case off. i did manage to tape the button back on with duct tape. i must change my review from four stars back down to 1. sorry unu. you should go back to the drawing board and address all your customer complaints about this product and redesign this thing from the ground up.","got back to me, but not through my attempts to contact them, but by commenting on this review. shortly after writing my initial review "
472,"i have been using unus dx5 external iphone 5 battery case for several months and am generally very happy with it and did not really know what to expect from the new unu aero wireless charging iphone 55s battery case.  after receiving a free sample to review here are my thoughtsexperiences with the product after several weeks of usage.pros  the case charges wirelessly.  all that has to be done is to place the case on the charging mat and in 45h the case is fully charged.  how easy is that?!  moreover if your iphone 55s is in the case, the wireless charging mat will charge both the case and the iphones own internal battery which is very convenient.  i have gone several days between charges as a result.  the case also has a switch on the back so you can determine when to start using the cases charging capacity and when to draw from the iphones own battery.  near the onoff switch are series of 4 leds that indicate how much charge is remaining in the case which is very helpful especially if you are unable to charge your phone regularly.  if for any reason you forget to pack the charging mat you are still able to charge the case by using the micro usb cable that is included.  you can find the micro usb port on the bottom of the case.  aesthetically the cases matted finish looks good and is very easy to hold.  the case is very easy to put on and take off your iphone 55s yet is still quite sturdy and has already protected my phone from the occasional drop.cons  one of my major criticisms of the dx5 was its size and while the aero is markedly slimmer it is still a bit bulky for an everyday case.  again it is a 2000mah battery case, there is going to be some size with it.  the recessed earphone port is difficult to access with some ear buds but unu does include an extension cable which is helpful.i can say i was wrong to expect only an incremental improvement from the dx5 but the unu aero has several  features that make it my charging case of choice and will keep my dx5 case on a shelf.",  after receiving a free sample to review here are my thoughtsexperiences with the product after several weeks of usage.
781,"i have had a ton of 34power banks34 pass my way over the last 12 months. the reality is that every one that has crossed my path has been able to charge my lumia 1020, my old blackberry and my iphone 5s without problem. ive had varying capacities and so on.the eachine is definitely one of the nicer ones ive received. what helps make it stand out is the fact that, like very few others ive had, there is a nice lcd display to show you the actual percentage of battery power left in the power bank. usually you just get a few lights to indicate, never really knowing just how much of that final light really is left and if you need to recharge now, or after one more cycle. no more guessing here.the other nice thing is the price for a 10,400 mah external battery with the lcd capability. definitely sets this one out above some of the others ive had and still have.also making this one stand out is the included tips. none of the others ive used in this price range have offered a usb micro to usb mini plug adapter. to be clear, this would make your micro usb cable plug into a miniusb chargeable device. it also includes micro usb to the older style ios charger no lightning included. there is also a nokia adapter for older nokia phones, though i cant test that one out. still, usually you just get a cable to charge the power bank.the capacity of 10,400, given the general efficiency for recharging, will net you roughly 5.5  6 full charges of an iphone 5s. my lumia 1020 will get 45 recharges. this is about normal for all power banks. physics be darned!also nice is that you can charge 2 devices at once. it isnt recommended to charge 2 devices and charge the power bank at the same time as this can affect, negatively, the life expectancy of the power bank itself.when it comes to portability, this one isnt too bad. 10,400 mah worth of batteries inside means its kinda heavy, but not overly so. it can easily fit in your back pocket or hand bag for an emergency charge if needed.it also includes a flashlight. its bright enough to see in the dark, but its not great.overall, this is a great power bank with some good features that sets it above the pack.highly recommended.i received a free sample for review purposes from the manufacturer.",i received a free sample for review purposes from the manufacturer.

594,"i have had this for about two weeks now, and it is a really cool device. it has come in handy while at work because i have to keep my phone in my locker but for some reason my battery drains faster while in there. so during my lunch break i plug it into the external battery charger, and it charges it up for me! i think having the flashlight attached is a great feature.i dont know that it would come in handy often, but it is a great added feature.the one negative im seeing so far is the included charger for my iphone 4s does not want to stay in when i have my phone case on. so i have to take it off just to charge the phone. which isnt a huge deal since my case can easily be removed. but overall i think it is a really great product and is worth having for a back up battery. having smartphones causes us to be on them more often which causes the battery to drain quickly. so its really great to have.i received this product as a free sample for review.",i received this product as a free sample for review.

371,"i have never been a fan of wireless charging, but trying out this unu product may have made me a fan. the main reason i have been against this product is because while the phone is charging on the mat it is pretty much impossible to use it without taking it off the doc, and im the type of guy that doesnt like to disturb the phones charging process. especially in the last 5, where its shown to affect the phones battery life. in my mind, having to do this with wireless charging has always prevented me from purchasing one of these products. however using this case has shown me that its not all bad. first of all, you dont have to use the wireless charging mat, you can just as easily plug in the case with the cord they provide, thereby using the case simply as a backup battery which is awesome. moreover, as a medical student i found the mat to significantly improve by productivity because when its on the mat basically my phone is unavailable to me, leaving me with limited distractions.those are my personal thoughts, now heres some of the more traditional stuffi love the finish on the case, its sort of a matte material which really makes the case feel great and gives it some traction. however, i have had cases in the past with this finish and it just ends up peeling off, hopefully it doesnt happen to this one. the battery isnt exactly a full 100 charge, i got somewhere between 80 and 95 percent while using it, but still its plenty to get you through the day.the case also is surprisingly very light and minimal. the most surprising thing to me is that on the top the case is flush with the screen, so theres no ridges around the perimeter. this is good because of the minimal feel that it gives, but also means that there is a lack of protection if the phone falls flat on its face.other battery cases ive used have a different structure, where the iphone already has a case and the battery back can slide inout as you please. i liked this idea as it allowed me to use the battery pack only when i need it, and avoid any extra bulk. however, seeing as this is a wireless charging case, i suppose unu expects us to always want to keep it on. i still think the option would have been nice but i realize its kind of going against the whole purpose of the product. also the way the case snaps in over the iphone is a bit scary, i havent read any reviews about it breaking, but still i get nervous every time.only main concern i have is that i wish the charging cord they provide was a little bit longer.overall though the case delivers on what it promises to be a wireless charging case with a backup battery with little shortcomings. most of my critiques have to do w the form of the case itself and its short charger cord. but i suppose if you are looking for protection you might as well go with an otter box!i was supplied a sample of the product for test and evaluation and i promised to provide a fair and honest review.", but i suppose if you are looking for protection you might as well go with an otter box!i was supplied a sample of the product for test and evaluation and i promised to provide a fair and honest review.
704,"i have other chargers that hold a lot more power, but theyre much heavier than this little thing. this took me about 1.5 hours to charge from zero. out of one charge i can fully recharge my galaxy note 3 or get about 80 on my ipad from nearly zero.i used this while using the ipad to play music and surf and it obviously charged much more slowly when i did that, but it still continued to have an upward charge. it got me from 20 to about 45 while doing that over the course of a couple of hours before i drained the charge from this unit.great for lightweight travel or to have in your purse during a normal day. i have the larger maxboost which is better for long trips or traveling where i need more charges and have fewer opportunities to get to an outlet.sample provided with no obligation to review.",sample provided with no obligation to review.
39,"i have previously purchased the continuous spray sunscreen from goddess garden.  i really love how their sunscreens smell, and i love how they pay attention to the ingredients they use, which in turn go onto my body and the bodies of my children.  this formula is thin, easy to apply, and easy to rub in so you dont look like a ghost.  my husband, however, has a hard time getting the sunscreen to rub in all the way on his face, and so grumbles when this is his only option when were out and about.the first time i purchased this spray, i had issues with the nozzle clogging and the spray not coming out, and it was clearly not empty.  i had purchased it at a local natural foods store, and they took the can back and exchanged it, no questions asked.  the second can had no issues.  this was just as the new spray was released.  i have had no issues with this can, nor any other cans since.most importantly, this sunscreen has done a great job of keeping us safe in the sun.  we just spent a weekend at a theme park, lotioned up first thing in the morning, and again at lunch, and not a bit of redness for any of us, without using nasty chemicals that will do whoknowswhat to us in the long run.prosexcellent, thoughtful ingredients that are not considered harmful to usgreat smellgreat delivery of productworks!conscan sometimes leave a white haze, but isnt always the casep.s. ive also used the regular spray, the one that isnt pressurized.  this product is similar, probably somewhat thinner and easier to rub in, but more or less the same, with similar effectiveness.  you do get more product with the other bottle, but you do have to be careful about turning the nozzle so it doesnt inadvertently spray all over the inside of your backpack.  this container has a great, clear clicktop to keep it from spraying when you dont want it to spray.disclosure of material connection i will receive a lowvalue free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review. i was not required or compelled to write a positive review. the opinions i have expressed are my own. i am disclosing this in accordance with ftc 16 cfr, part 255.",disclosure of material connection i will receive a lowvalue free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.
777,"i have quite a few of these external battery packs, and this is probably one of the nicest ones that i have reviewed.  in terms of size, most of them scale with the size of the battery.  this one is 5.534 long, 2.434 wide, and 0.7534 deep, but is able to hold a whopping 10400 mah which is enough to charge a phone a few times or an ipad about 1.5 times.  the battery has a nice finish on the outside and feels very high quality, with a beveled edge which makes it great to grip.  many of these batteries have a cheap look and feel, but this one is quite well done.there are 2 normal usb ports for supplying power, one for 2.1a and the other for 1a.  i was able to charge both my ipad and iphone simultaneously from it.  there is a nice blue backlit lcd display to tell you how much battery power is left.  many of my external battery packs just used 14 leds to show approximate power, so this lcd display is appreciated.  the adapter also comes with a slew of adapters as well to help you connect it up.  topping it off, there is a builtin white led light, a nice feature.i was carrying a much larger 15000mah battery, but i never used the whole thing, so i think this much smaller battery will become my new battery of choice for the size and utility.  it packs the most punch into the smallest package.note i received a free sample from the manufacturer for the purposes of review.",note i received a free sample from the manufacturer for the purposes of review.
373,"i have received a free sample of this case for review by unu through their utry program. i have used this case for a little over a week now as my main phone case for my iphone 5s and i love the case. once again, unu makes an amazing case and has obviously put a lot of thought into making this product amazing. starting off with everything good, the case itself is very slim and fits into any pocket easily. the bulkiness of other cases make carrying an iphone a hassle but unu has done a great job in slimming this case down and creating a product that works well and saves space. in addition, i have yet to run into any problems with charging the case. the case, when full, will get me from 10100 easily and the case itself charges rather quickly relative to other charging cases. the button on the base is within easy access yet is concealed enough so that it makes it difficult to accidentally press the button and begin charging when you dont mean to. the led lights on the back are also great indicators to tell me how much charge i have left, however those led lights can somewhat be misleading. it usually shows that there is a lot more charge than there actually is, but it isnt that big of a problem. the wireless charging dock is also a great addition, as it takes away a lot of problems when charging, making everything just that much easier. the only problems that i have found with the battery case is that the power button at the top becomes very difficult to press and it takes a lot of effort to get the iphones power button to respond. in addition, the snapon style of the battery case can sometimes be difficult to either take on or off. however, these problems arent great enough to take away anything from the case and i highly recommend this case to anyone looking for a battery case.",i have received a free sample of this case for review by unu through their utry program.

282,"i have received a free sample of this product, but i dont think it would make any difference.  the unu flexi portable usb battery pack is one of the most convenient power chargers i have ever dealt with.  first, its design is incredible, except for the flexible cable.  the cable is slightly annoying to use and stretches too tightly.  on the other hand, this is a slim device with an accessible power button in the center.  often, i slip it in my backpack and charge my iphone 3gs when needed. sometimes, it does disconnect for some reason.  for that reason, the practicability is average as nothing stands out.  its battery life does double the life of your iphone, but it does wear out pretty quickly.  additionally, i had a hard time finding how to charge the device when i first used it.  there are two ports on the side, one named 34in34.  all in all, i would recommend this product to a friend.","i have received a free sample of this product, but i dont think it would make any difference."

433,"i have tried multiple different battery packs so far for my iphone.  due to the apps i like to have one and use during the day my battery drains relatively quickly.  i applied for the free sample from unu as i didnt want to spend any more money finding another battery pack.i admit i was skeptical about this one as it does charge with a usb connector and not the normal lightening connector.  i was pleasantly surprised to find that the base was truly a good solution for charging 8211 and found a way to have the base setup in my car to charge while i8217m driving.  multiple charging pads are useful, so when you buy this think about purchasing one or two other charging pads as well.  a nice feature is when the battery is charging the phone the lights dont remain on, this is annoying with other cases when im trying to record my kids band concert and need to charge the phone.i really like the case, it8217s super slim, durable, and works well.  the connection for the ear buds seems to be common for any battery pack that is not 100 lbs. and it was nice that they provide an extension so one doesnt have to mush the cable into the phone.i waited a week before writing this review as i can be tough on my electronics i am very often dropping my phone or having it fall off of something.  this case held up really well and much better than some of my previous battery packs cases.  with the black cover the nicks are not noticeable and even when i tripped and fell going into my house and my phone and the charging pad went flying out of my hands, both worked perfectly fine even with the scratches that they both ended up experiencing.i did find that if the phone is moved to often on the base it will stop charging, this may be a precautionary measure and i8217m just aware of where i place it when it is charging.  for those who like to play on their phones while charging like me having an extra usb cable around is extremely helpful.in the end i have to say that i am really impressed with this battery pack and charger and have found that even when my phone batter has fully died, that the battery pack was able to bring it back something most of my other ones could not do.  it is great that it also is seen as a legitimate iphone charger so the annoying messages are not coming up. most of my other battery packs have given me enough extra battery to last about 10 hours, this one gave me a full 24 hours of usage with my phone  which shocked me since i had twice let my phone die because i forgot to turn on the battery.this is a definite buy and don8217t forget to get

72,"i have two different ihangy lanyards, and i have to admit this one is my favorite. the rubber cord is very comfortable on a bare neck, making a better choice than the other one for wearing for longer periods if you dont have a collar although the other one has earphones and i like it better for my ipod, so each has its benefits. i take a daily 45 minutes walk on my lunch hour at work and i no longer have to worry about dropping my phone because i have to carry it when i dont have pockets.although i havent used it for cycling yet, i can see this being a big help when riding, when i often want to have my phone readily available for pics along the trail. i used to tuck my phone under my bra strap, but i shorted out my last iphone by sweating on it! the lanyard is going to be great for when i want to grab the phone quick for a picture.it is very easy to take on and off the idevice by just pressing in on the tips of the stylus. i dont use a stylus with my iphone, but if you do, i expect it would be handy. overall, i am really pleased with the ihangy.i received the ihangy for free in exchange for my honest review.",i received the ihangy for free in exchange for my honest review.
268,"i have two other 34namebrand34 external battery chargers and find that this one compares very closely in terms of charging time about 1 per minute for an iphone 5. this is actually smaller and lighter than the others. also, this one has a list price that is considerably cheaper.all the drum beating on and around the product about how it is made in america is kind of amusing. im not sure why other reviewers would have a problem with the 34garish34 label on its underbelly its not like you stick it on your forehead and wear it around. however, im not sure what aspect of this product is actually made here. the instructions, for example, certainly dont read like they were written by a native speaker of english. still, i could be wrong.anyhow, if you need an external charger to buy you some extra time when youll be out of plug in range, this one is competitive with more expensive models and much cheaper.i was given a sample of this product to provide an unbiased review.",i was given a sample of this product to provide an unbiased review.

602,"i have used many external batteries over the years and most of them do a decent job of charging my devices in the field.  i always have one along on a weekend camping trip.  the new maxboost 15000mah external battery kept my iphone and kindle fire hdx and a second kindle going for several days.  i could not believe it.  i own two other batteries, both from anker.  one of them is the same size as the maxboost, but does not give me as many charges.  i love the blue lcd that lets me know how much battery is left.  the unit comes with adapters for various phones as well as dual usb output ports, a 1.0a and a 2.1a.  as an added bonus, there is a flashlight is built into the side and activates by pressing the silver button twice.  the flashlight came in very handy in my tent the other night.  all in all, this is the battery i have been looking for.  it works better than advertised and because of this, i thought it deserved an easy 5 stars.for disclosure purposes, i was given a free sample for review.","for disclosure purposes, i was given a free sample for review."
328,"i have used several charging options including boost case, leitz and the duracell powermat. the unu aero series is the most incredible, easy to use charger i have ever used. they have taken wireless charging to a whole new level. full disclosure i did receive a free product to try. this in no way influences my take on the product. this product is excellent because unu has put a great deal of time and effort into creating a much better product. i normally have a hard time just getting the case and then the battery on my iphone 5. the case and charger both slipped on easily in only a few minutes. the case is smooth and looks seamless. my case is white and it blends beautifully with the white color of my phone. it covers all edges and adds only minimal weight. with most cases, i would use the case and add the battery option later because they were often cumbersome. not the unu. it fits into my purse holder easily. it comes with an extension for headsets that work well since the bottom is elongated. there are two conductors on the back that blend in beautifully that are used to connect to the charging pad, which is included unlike the duracell powermat. there is a recessed button to start charging the phone and four small holes that shine with blue light to inform you of the battery level 1 for low, 4 full charge. press the button to start charging the phone, which is fast. when the phone is fully charged, the charger shuts itself off, which i love. when you need to charge the case and you can charge the phone as well simply plug in the cord with the microusb plug to your iphone adapter and place the phone on the pad.the phone will charge completely first, then the battery will charge. i ran down both and it took about 5 hours to fully charge both. at night, you can see the four lights blinking when laid flat. when the different levels are charged, that light stops blinking. when all four stop, the battery is fully charged. i love that simple, elegant feature that enabled me to check its status at a glance. you can purchase wireless charging pads for about 25.00, which make this system very affordable. duracels powermats are not nearly as well made or easy to use and are much more expensive. the case has all the required cutouts and provides protection for your phone. while this does provide protection, i would try to avoid dropping your phone with the case so as not to damage the battery case, it is not meant as a rugged case like an otterbox. unu has really hit a home run in my book, with a powerful, elegant, easy to use battery and case to keep your phone juiced. i highly recommend this product and absolutely love it!", full disclosure i did receive a free product to try.

760,"i originally purchased the ibikeconsole waterproof shockprotected mount and was using it regularly.  i researched and read a lot of reviews here on amazon and landed on the original 34heavy duty34 case.  it has been great for everything i needed, although a little cumbersome to swap in and out for rides.  it protected against sweat drip, excess bottle spray and allowed me to use my bluetooth cadencespeed sensor and heart monitors.  the ability to use my iphone as my bike computer was the real reason i bought the heavy duty mount.the new 34lite34 mount improves upon the heavy duty mount for my purposes.the installation of the lite mount on the stem of my bike took all of 2 minutes with the included allen wrench.  the lite mount came with an additional piece of rubber to place between the stem and the mounting brace mechanism that did not come with the heavy duty.  this allowed me to tighten the mount down better and reduce any potential road vibration.the actual mount case that holds the iphone for the lite version is very similar to my incase slim cover that i use for everyday carrying.  the only difference is the small locking mechanism circle on the back of the case that fits to the bike mount it fits in my jersey pocket with no problem.  the locking mechanism itself is simple and only requires a quick twist of the phone to the mount.  after twisting the phone onto the mount, there is a locking switch that holds the phone in place securely.  to remove the phone, unlock the switch and press two release buttons to twist the phone back off.the lite also comes with a waterproof cover that fits over the phonecase.  i have had no problems using the functions of my phone while riding and it provides the necessary sweat and bottle spray protection i am looking for.  it is very easy to slip on and off the phonecase.to me, the lite is considerably less of a hassle to put on and remove from my bike.  the heavy duty has essentially two cases and although it provides a little more protection, i dont envision needing this on my road bike.  if i were putting a mount on a mountain or cross bike, i might go for the heavy duty case.  but since i only ride on the road, the lite provides all the protection i am looking for.overall, i am very satisfied with both mounts, but will be using the lite mount going forward.i am a past bike2power customer. this product was provided to me free of charge in exchange for my honest review.", this product was provided to me free of charge in exchange for my honest review.

606,"i previously used the smaller sibling of this power bank  themaxboost pulse 10000mah dualport 3a premium usb portable external battery pack so will compare this one to that model. i received this as a review sample and it arrived charged one hundred percent.  i still put it on a charger for two hours before testing it out.in most cases this model is simply bigger and higher capacity than its sibling.  at 15000 mah it has over ten times the capacity of a stock iphone 4 or 5 series, which are  rated at 1420 mah. it comes in at just under five times the 3200 mah capacity of my samsung galaxy note 3, and exceeds by about forty percent the capacity of a fourth generation ipads 11,560 mah battery. in other words, this has impressive storage and charging capabilities.it has a micro usb port input for charging the unit itself. its nestled between the two usb out ports and can be a tight fit depending on which cables out you are using. for charging, though, you can use the cable that is provided or your own. the two usb out ports are at different levels. one is rated at 1a and the other is 2.1a and can be used simultaneously. it also ships with an adapter cable with mini and micro usb ends, as well as an apple 30 pin connector.note i have found that this works best when you do not attempt to charge the unit while its powering other devices. i did use this to power my galaxy note 3 and a bluetooth speaker for music and still had sixtyfive percent remaining capacity according to the led display twelve hours later. that is impressive to me. in fact i love the large blue lit display that shows the percent remaining power. that feature sets this apart from the myriad of other battery packs i have tested in the past except the smaller sibling of this model. for me its a convenience, but for folks who are emergency responders or who are preparing for an emergency this feature is critical.this also comes with a builtin flashlight that is not particularly powerful, butt makes this perfect for emergencies. it is a bit large and heavy at 4.25 x 2.8 x .8 inches and 8.2 ounces.one final note if you discharge this pack down to five to ten percent remaining charge it can take up to twelve hours to charge it back up using a standard wall charger. considering the capacity that is not an unreasonable amount of time. this will probably not charge via a computer usb port  just had to see and after two hours mine did not increase by a percent.bottom line compared to its sibling this model gives the most bang for your buck. more importantly, it is a definite value when compared to most other competing models on the market.",received this as a review

869,"i really love the feel of the leather on this ipad mini case.  it is so soft but at the same time thick enough to provide ample protection for the device.  looking at the picture before receiving the product, i though the design is kinda tacky.  when i received it in my hands, it actually looks nice, only 2 shades of brown.the mini attaches using leather reinforced elastic bands at four corners.  the camera hole is at the right spot.  the case works great by putting the mini to sleep when you close the cover and waking it up by opening it.  speakerst. are not obstructed at all and you can charge the mini without removing the case.  the thing that i have a hard time reaching is the volume control and the  side button for mutelock rotation the top right elastic band is obstructing it.  if not, i can easily rate this five stars.  lastly, you can securely close the case with a snap button making sure the case will not open if you accidentally drop the ipad.sample item was provided by the distributor for an evaluation review.",sample item was provided by the distributor for an evaluation review.
9,"i received a 16 necklace free from the seller, in exchange for an honest review.im very happy with this necklace, and have already enjoyed wearing it.  its real sterling silver, not just coated metal, and the snakepattern links keep it kinkfree.  its thick enough to stand up to daily wear and pendants, yet thin enough to be feminine and eyecatching.  the clasp is substantial so there are no worries about it coming loose and being lost.  and the included gift box is attractive enough for gift giving.  overall, this is a great deal for the cost 15.99 and free shipping  especially given that the price of silver is so high these days.","i received a 16 necklace free from the seller, in exchange for an honest review."

275,"i received a free charger from the seller to review, and found enough good and bad points that i8217m conflicted about what rating to give.the charger itself measures 2.58221 x 4.58221 x 5168221, and is just a little bit larger than my ipod touch 4th gen. in fact, i tried putting the ipod case on the charger and it actually fit, albeit with a little stretching on one edge of the case. the charger came with a flat usb cable that is 408221 long, 8221 wide and 1168221 thick and in a color that matches the charger housing. the back of the sample i received is covered with a variety of information, part of which asks for a five star review. i see from stephen m. charme8217s review that the seller informed him that the tacky text is only placed on sample units, but i agree with stephen that i can only review what i8217m given. additionally, i find the 8220designed for america8221 and american flag logo to be intentionally i assume misleading, since the units are made in china. this is the kind of marketing tricks that i find distasteful.with the above things being said, the charger does do an okay job of charging, but it definitely doesnt put out 5 volts at 2 amps. i know this not because i have an ammeter, but because the charger cannot keep up with my galaxy note 2 phone while playing one of my favorite games, even with volume muted and the screen brightness turned almost all the way down. tonight i plugged the charger into my phone and played my game for about an hour. the phone8217s battery was at 17 when i started playing and in spite of showing that it was charging, the battery level dropped to 8 by the end of the hour. the note 28217s giant screen and fast processor make it difficult to charge when it8217s under heavy load, but the 2 amp wall charger that came with the phone is able to slowly charge the phone under the conditions i used to test the 5 star america charger.the 5 star america charger had much more success when paired with my ipod touch 4th generation. i plugged the ipod into the charger with the ipod battery at about 10 and played music for five continuous hours while driving. at the end of my drive, the ipod8217s battery was completely charged and the charger was displaying two of its three battery indicator lights.the charger itself can be charged using the included cable or any standard micro usb b cable and any usb wall ac or car dc charger. i used a 3 amp wall charger and a 2.5 amp car charger and saw charging times between three and four hours to charge the depleted charger.when i rate an item, i take into account the performance the product offers for the price charged for the item. the charger is currently being offered at 13.99, which is competitive with other similar products being sold on amazon. the 5 star america charger does not, however, live up to the claims of the seller. had i paid 14 for this device, i wouldn8217t think i got a deal, but i wouldnt feel like i got ripped off either. in my opinion, it8217s an okay buy for someone looking for an inexpensive, 3100mah charger, but there may be better buys to be had.","i received a free charger from the seller to review, and found enough good and bad points that i8217m conflicted about what rating to give."

409,"i received a free sample for review to experience the product. i must say that this case is way more durable than unu dx case. the case is very sturdy and it takes quite a bit of effort to take off the case which is awesome. the dx case top half always kept getting loose and coming of. the wireless charging is awesome and is the same as if it was directly connected via a cable. one thing that i think would had made this case the perfect case was if the designed to stick out a bit towards the front of the phone. as a result if u lay the phone face down it will be resting directly on the front screen. this means that if i were to drop my phone my screen has a greater chance of shattering. but overall this case rocks and feels nicer than other cases out there. also unu warranty is awesome and will provide you a replacement case, incase there was a problem with your case. the rear of case has 4 led lights. each dot represents 25 of charge",i received a free sample for review to experience the product.

466,"i received a free sample from unu to review this product.  this is the third battery case i have had for the iphone 5.  generic china battery case that sometimes doesnt work with ios 7, the morphie air, and this case.the quality of this case is comparable to the mophie if not better.  the unu has an exposed volume silence switch which i prefer.  on the mophie you have to line it up when inserting the case and i always felt like it didnt work that well.  the unu is a ittle tougher to get to as its recessed but i prefer that over less of a tactile feel.  the mophie power button is free floating compared to the unu which is attached on the left side.  this causes not much give on the left side of the switch but you get more of a tactile feel.  with the mophie i had to put some paper in the button so it was more tactile.so all in all this is a great battery case with the added feature of wireless charging.  i actually prefer this style of wireless charging over the magnet types.  with the magnet types if it is not centered it sometimes doesnt charge.  this case will charge as long as it is somewhere on the wireless charging pad.all three cases require a headphone adapter which is an annoyance but is the price you pay for an extended battery case.",i received a free sample from unu to review this product.

659,"i received a free sample from vipu program for evaluation. the electron mini battery pack by maxboost is a great battery pack for charging. the battery pack charges fully from 0 to 100 in about 34 hours. i usually let it charge overnight it makes it easier for me. i can get about 2 and half charges from the phone being at 1 and getting it to 100 out of the battery pack if i am using it to charge my iphone 5s. for my ipad 2 i am able to get about 1 charge 1 to 100 from the battery pack. it is very handy and small, fits right into my pocket and it has the weight feeling of my iphone 4s. i use to this battery pack to mainly charge my iphone since i use that more than my ipad. i highly recommend this battery pack for anyone who is looking for a reliable battery pack because i have dropped it a few times with no physical or hardware damage to it still works as good as the first day i used it and it comes with an led light. the only downside was that i wasn8217t able to use it right out of the box i had to charge it first but the charge times wasn8217t long so it still makes it a good product to useget.",i received a free sample from vipu program for evaluation.

264,"i received a free sample in return for a honest review.i am a user, rather than a geekytype.  so my review is simply based upon my impressions as a user, and no test equipment was used or harmed in this review.when it first came, i gave it to my wife and said, 34here, use it and tell me what you think.34  her reply after asking what to use it for was that its a pretty color, and it works, holds a charge, and will recharge her dumb cell phone from dead to full charge in less than 2 hours, and it can do it 3 times on one charge.then i borrowed it back, charged it, unplugged it and let it sit for a week.  took only 5 minutes to top off the charge after sitting for a week.  then took my iphone 4, drained it til it died, and used this to recharge it.  took bout 25 minutes to charge it enough to be used, and brought it up to full in 2.5hrs while making calls and using it.  granted, i was using the iphone too, but it took roughly onehalf of the charge to do it.its small, easy to carry and use.  why only 4 stars?  very hard to open the packaging, and dislike the printing on one side of the unit  it spoils the look of it.  no instructions for use either.the cable matching the color is a nice touch, as is the 999 day warranty  i assume the warranty works, i had no need to use it.",i received a free sample in return for a honest review.
454,"i received a free sample of the aero wireless charging system to test with my iphone 5s. the idea of wireless charging has always intrigued me, and im glad to finally have some firsthand experience with the technology.let me begin with the cases outward appearance and handling. i was actually surprised by its thinness as even unus previous cases have been relatively bulky. the matte finish is soft to the touch and comfortable to hold. the metal pieces that form wireless the connection are seamlessly integrated into the back of the case.as for battery life, its fantastic. while it wont normally give your phone a full 100, it gives you enough to last through a day of heavy use. the case charges very quickly and has no trouble making a connection with the charging mat. the only issue ive experienced through my regular use is the looseness of some of the clasps that keep the front of the case attached to the back. fortunately, the issue is not dramatic enough to cause the case to come apart completely while in your hand, so it can be overlooked.all in all, this is a very good example of how sleek and easytouse wireless charging cases should be.",i received a free sample of the aero wireless charging system to test with my iphone 5s.

477,"i received a free sample of the unu aero wireless charging battery case and mat for iphone 5 and have been using it for approximately one month. i must say that i am duly impressed!first, it is sturdier than similar cases but relatively light. in other words, it doesnt weigh down the phone. this is important when it comes to usage because similar cases have been so heavy that they have caused muscle strain.next, it charges the phone quite a bit faster than other battery cases that ive tried. i like that it automatically charges the phone first and then itself.the charging mat is a wonderful plus because it expands your charging options. as long as you can plug into a usb port, you can charge the case or the mat. its really simple. just place the encased phone on the mat to charge.the only thing that i would change is to make the charger compatible with apple accessories. as it is now, the case is only compatible with unu accessories. the cord is several inches shorter than the apple lightning cable that comes with the iphone.i am a very satisfied customer. the unu aero wireless charging battery case and mat for iphone 5 lives up to everything the company promises.",i received a free sample of the unu aero wireless charging battery case and mat for iphone 5 and have been using it for approximately one month.
679,"i received a free sample of this battery pack for review from vipu maxboost.  overall, i am very pleased with this extended battery pack.  aesthetically, the form factor is very nice, and it is very useful to have the screen readout of the remaining percentage.  i just have two small complaints 1 i am not a fan of the glossy plastic.  it attracts fingerprints like a magnet and most products these days are using more matted plastics, which i also think look better. 2 the screen readout has burned out areas around the in and out text, as well as around the 5v. the percentage is fine though, and easy to read.otherwise, the battery is packed with excellent features.  the capacity of 5600 mah is enough to charge most phones several times over, and i appreciate how the smart usb port can differentiate when to charge at the correct amps up to 2.1a appropriately, between phones and tablets.  the flashlight, which you activate by double tapping the power button, is especially handy when trying to orientate those pesky micro usb cables in the dark.  the device arrived with just under half charge 47 and was fully charged within a few hours of plugging it in.  i then used it to fully charge my iphone 5s quite speedily.  give it a matte plastic finish and fix the quality control on some of the screens, and i think you8217ve got a near perfect product.",i received a free sample of this battery pack for review from vipu maxboost.
332,"i received a free sample of this for review and i cannot remember life before it.  seriously.  prior to this case, i was using another battery case to make it through my day with my iphone 5s and i thought i had the best option out there.  i was totally wrong.  the unu aero series wireless case is light years beyond everything else ive ever tried.  i bought myself an extra wireless pad for work so i have one on my desk and one at home.  the charging case works like any other product youd expect from unu.  its well designed, reliable and sleek.  the case has a great feel and i appreciate that theres a bumper around the battery pack so that nothing pops out.  the bumper is removable but takes a little work to remove.  its ideal though as it never comes off unless you want it to.  i did drop the phone in the case once and the bumper popped off but there was no damage to the phone and the bumper snapped right back on.  the volume and power buttons are accentuated and the mute switch is recessed but easily reachable so youll have no trouble accessing controls.  the headphone jack requires an extender but thats included with the case and the microusb port is really sturdy on the rare occasion that you need to charge somewhere other than the wireless pad.the wireless feature is absolutely irreplaceable.  prior to owning this case, i had no idea how many times per night i would remove my phone from the charger to answer a text message or check email.  im a pavlovian slave to notifications and now i simply lift my phone from the pad and put it back down.  i can 34plug34 the phone back in without a light on, without looking and without any effort.  at work, i leave my desk a zillion times a day and grab my phone each time.  when i return, i simply place my phone back on the pad.  im actually finding that i hardly need the extra battery during the day now because the ease of charging has drastically changed how far charged my phone stays.  apparently, prior to this wireless charging pad, it was inconvenient to plug in after i got back to my desk, so my battery ran down.i absolutely love this case.  i think its way better looking that the competitors and again, kinda cant believe i ever used an iphone without it.  you wont regret the benefits of this case.  not at all.",i received a free sample of this for review and i cannot remember life before it.

922,"i received a free sample of this product in return for a review, but note that my reviews are fair and unbiased at all times. i call them as i see them.this highly portable speaker is meant to attach to a smartphone or maybe a tablet as a small and simple external speaker. it comes with two cables one for usb charging, and one for attaching to the desired device. the latter is coiled and stretches to just under a foot in length. the coil idea is clever and makes for easy storage i just leave it attached at all times when im not charging the speakers internal battery.how well does it work? the sound quality is decent if you keep in mind the small form factor. dont expect sizzling highs and booming lows. do expect a surprisingly full and clear sound with good definition. the 1.5 watt output not sure what input this is obtained with, i suppose 1 volt rms or something is enough for a small table in a small conference room or maybe a small patio. if you want to fill a concert hall, get something larger.the pros light, portable, easy to use, very practical,  good sound for the size. has a suction cup on the bottom. this is really clever and you can stick the speaker to the back of your phone and carry it around if you like.the cons no lights or controls. you have to guess when its fully charged, or just charge it long enough to be safe. theres no volume control the speaker runs at a fixed amplification and volume is changed via source device. this makes overdriving the speaker, with consequent distortion, more likely. these two objections combined knock a star off the rating.bottom line the market for such speakers is crowded. ive myself reviewed a couple of others and many more are out there. some sound better and some have more and better lightscontrols. some sound worse, and many cost more. none of them have the clever coiled cord or the even more clever suction cup. so i would say if you want ultimate portability while retaining decent audio quality, this is a good choice.","i received a free sample of this product in return for a review, but note that my reviews are fair and unbiased at all times."
708,"i received a free sample to try out from maxboosts vipu program. at first i struggled to figure out this device. where and what t plug it in to. luckily it comes with a users manual for this reason. i plugged the battery pack into my computer in an attempt to charge it, but to my surprise it already came charged at 100. i found this to be impressive. i unplugged it and tried to plug the included wire into my ipad mini. this is where i hit a bump in the road. the included wire does not fit all devices, and apple products seem to be included in this list. instead of forcing the connection, which could have caused damage, i discovered that i was able to switch the wires for the one i usually plug into the wall to charge my ipad. this is also helpful because i learned that i could use that same wall plug that i use to charge my ipad to charge my maxboost electron mini battery pack. i watched eagerly as my device charged. as the ipads numbers went up the battery packs numbers went down. my ipad started at 17 and was able to charge all the way to 100 with the battery pack starting at 100 and ending at 2. this is very great if you are in a pinch. it is a bit of an emergency device, or life line if you are stranded. this is why i appreciate the built in flashlight and portability of the device. it could really come in handy if i am ever in an emergency situation. i also like the versatility of it, it can be used to charge anything with a usb port. i would recommend it to anyone and i would definitely buy it.",i received a free sample to try out from maxboosts vipu program.

857,"i received a review sample and charged it up right after unpacking it. initial charge time was about two hours, after which i tested this on my samsung galaxy note 3. that phone was at 90 when i plugged this in and it quickly climbed to 100 in about thirty minutes. note that my phone is relatively new so the battery will respond to rapid charging better than a phone that has undergone a year or more of charging cycles.this is a compact battery that measures 4.5 inches long by 2.25 inches wide and a very thin 14 inch height. the case is constructed of what appears to be brushed aluminum and high impact plastic, and i am relatively sure it will survive short falls from chest height.what i love, though is the incredible 4000mah charging rate. this is twentyfive percent more capacity than my note 3, which is a whopping 3200mah by itself. add this pack and it increases use time by 125.  its 2.8 times the 1420mah battery in an iphone 4s, so it nearly triples the use time of that device.however, there is even more to this pack than capacity it has overload protection that will shut down charging, and it can be reset with a small and easily accessible button near the main charging outlet.there is also a progress indicator that has a clever led sequence to give you a clear idea of how much capacity is remaining. solid red is 25 or less, flashing red is 2650, alternating flashing red and green indicates 51 to 75 and flashing green is up to 95. solid green means its fully charged.one final feature i love is this can be easily charged from a regular charger or your laptop or desktop system. some packs that i have tested and review will only work from a wall charger, so this is a plus but understand that it will take a lot longer to fully charge.like all review samples i am donating this one, but the engineering and construction is impressive. this is a pack i have no problem recommending to friends and family.",received a review 
247,"i received a review sample from the manufacturer and at first thought it was a mini tablet or mp3 player. its a tiny 4.5x3.5 inches and only 0.125 inches thick.the small size is deceptive because it packs 3100mah, which is sufficient to double my use time on my samsung galaxy note ii. for iphone users this pack will give you 2.18 times the capacity of your 1420mah battery. how that translates into extra hours depends on your usage patterns. if you are currently getting 18 hours on a galaxy note ii you can depend on at least 36 hours on it with this external power. it doubled a friends normal six hours on her iphone 4s.aside from the small size and large capacity this battery pack is the only one thus far that i have evaluated and reviewed that allows you to simultaneously charge the unit while its powering your phone or device. i must say that the claim of rapid charging is true. i literally watched my galaxy note iis battery percentage rise in mere minutes after plugging this in  it went from ninety five to one hundred percent in less than 15 minutes. note that it was not being used at the time. i am sure it would have been slower had i been browsing the web or playing music. however, no other battery pack i have tested charged nearly as fast.the charging cord that comes with it is interesting. its flat, notangle, but has very heavy duty strain reliefs on each end. one end is a standard usb and the other micro usb. on my galaxy i can charge the pack up with this cable, then plug it into the output port and the micro usb end fits my phone. or you can use whichever cable you choose.i normally do not discuss price in my reviews because they are subject to change. however i do want to note that at the time of this review this pack is significantly less than any other 3100mah pack i have tested or reviewed. prices will drop across the board when the next best thing comes along, but for now this is the price leader. when you factor in the features and overall quality of this pack the value proposition is compelling","i received a review sample from the manufacturer and at first thought it was a mini tablet or mp3 player. its a tiny 4.5x3.5 inches and only 0.125 inches thick.the small size is deceptive because it packs 3100mah, which is sufficient to double my use time on my samsung galaxy note ii. for iphone users this pack will give you 2.18 times the capacity of your 1420mah battery. how that translates into extra hours depends on your usage patterns. if you are currently getting 18 hours on a galaxy note ii you can depend on at least 36 hours on it with this external power. it doubled a friends normal six hours on her iphone 4s.aside from the small size and large capacity this battery pack is the only one thus far that i have evaluated and reviewed that allows you to simultaneously charge the unit while its powering your phone or device. i must say that the claim of rapid charging is true. i literally watched my galaxy note iis battery percentage rise in mere minutes after plugging this in  it went from ninety five to one hundred percent in less than 15 minutes. note that it was not being used at the time. i am sure it would have been slower had i been browsing the web or playing music. however, no other battery pack i have tested charged nearly as fast.the charging cord that comes with it is interesting. its flat, notangle, but has very heavy duty strain reliefs on each end. one end is a standard usb and the other micro usb. on my galaxy i can charge the pack up with this cable, then plug it into the output port and the micro usb end fits my phone. or you can use whichever cable you choose.i normally do not discuss price in my reviews because they are subject to change. however i do want to note that at the time of this review this pack is significantly less than any other 3100mah pack i have tested or reviewed. prices will drop across the board when the next best thing comes along, but for now this is the price leader. when you factor in the features and overall quality of this pack the value proposition is compelling"
428,"i received a review sample of this battery and charging system and was thoroughly impressed. not only does this significantly increase the battery capacity of an iphone 5 or 5s, but the case affords more protection than other cases i have tested. this system was tested with an iphone 5s.here are the key features and advantages as i see themextends capacity while the packaging indicates that this will double the use time of an iphone 5 and provide 85 percent more for the 5s, the actual results are a little better than claimed. for the iphone 5 the battery pack provides 138 more use time and for the 5s the figure is 127. this is based on the fact that this battery pack adds 2000mah milliamps per hour to the 1440mah that the iphone 5s battery has, and the same addition to the 1570mha for the 5s.note that increasing battery capacity increases use time, which is completely dependent upon how you use your phone. if you normally get ten hours between charges, with this battery you will at the very least double that for an iphone 5 and add another minimum of 8.5 hours to a 5s. those are conservative numbers that go along with the manufacturers claims. in practice you will get more with a newer phone since the battery has not deteriorated from multiple charging cycles.fit and protection the battery assembly is also a protective case with a soft synthetic back that cushions and absorbs shock. all of the cutouts are perfectly placed and all buttons and ports are available with the battery in place.do note that the case is a two piece assemble that consists of a back battery and bumper that you snap in place after you mate your phone with the lightning connector. once your phone is encased you will charge the battery with a standard micro usb cable one is provided with this battery. this has pros and cons. on the plus side you can ditch the proprietary cable the iphone 55s uses on the minus side any investment you have made in extra lightning cables is negated.you can charge and transfer data simultaneously, which is a feature that sets this battery apart from the competition. plus you can charge it via a computers usb port. not all batteries on the market will allow that  many i have tested would not charge that way.charging mat an added bonus is the wireless charging mat that is included with this battery. it actually does work i was a bit skeptical at first. in fact, it will charge up the external battery pack in almost the same time it takes to charge it via the micro usb connection from a regular charger. this adds not only convenience, but value because some of the iphone batteries i have tested in the past were in this ones price range and did not include a charging mat.overall this is a solution that is superbly engineered and manufactured. everything from the precision fit of the battery case to the way this solution performs to or exceeds claimed specifications warrants a solid five stars.",received a review 
423,"i received a sample case and charging mat to review from the myunu try program. i will provide a fair review.first off i own an android phone or two as well, and have always loved the qi wireless charging i can do with them. the iphone does not support this at all, but the folks at unu have brought us the next best thing. its wireless charging from the phone to the mat, but the mat has to be plugged into a power source to charge your case and phone. the 2 piece case you install on the iphone has two metal connectors on the back that once make contact to the metal charging mat begin charging the case and the phone. the battery is a 2000mah battery and charging this way takes longer then the standard plug into a wall outlet variety charge, but not terribly much more. the case can be activated with a touch of a button on the back which reveals by led lights how much juice is left in it and then it begins charring your phone on the go. the case is easy to install and uninstall and fits the phone well. all ports and camera area have plenty of room. it adds some weight and length to your iphone though and you have to use an included headphone adapter cable because the battery at the bottom extends the length that much. this is pretty common with most charging cases for the iphone5 because apple decided to put the headphone jack on the bottom of the phone. i have owned and used a mophie juice pack and this is very much like that. the big gain here is that you dont have to fuss with a lightning or micro usb cable to charge your phone. no more trying to find the plug in the dark or messy wires lying around. you have a nice mat you simply plop your phone down on, and bam, charging away. this is a great wireless charging solution for the iphone users out there. the case on the go also can charge your iphone from near dead to about 80 or so with the 2000mah battery on board. i like this solution as it takes the mophie juice pack to the next level with the wireless ability.",received a sample case and charging mat to review from the myunu try program. i will provide a fair review.

27,"i received a sample of this product free, but my opinions are my own.i love this product!! i have used it on my medium to long length, thick hair, and i love it. it definitely reduces frizz when blow drying. i generally only wash my hair every 2nd or 3rd day and worried that this would make my hair greasy, and id have to wash it more often, but i dont. if anything, it keeps it in good condition as long or longer.the biggest surprise and benefit has been to my calloused heels. i rub this on my heels at night, and the callouses are gone, so i can wear sandals proudly! i saw an almost immediate improvement in this area, but after 2 or 3 treatments, they were smooth and beautiful!","i received a sample of this product free, but my opinions are my own."

201,"i received a yubi power rapid usb car charger free from the vendor, in exchange for writing an honest review.when i removed this little charger from the clamshell package, i was impressed by the durable feel of it, and the tiny size.  my husband happened to be going on a business trip the next day, so i asked him to take the charger along and give it a try for me.he used it in his rental car with his own phone cable the whole week, and was very pleased with it.  he said it plugged securely into the cigarette lighter, although the blue led light verifies that the unit is fully plugged in and has power.  it was small enough that it didnt attract attention when he had clients in the car  it sticks out about one inch past the outlet.  his phone charged as quickly as it does with the verizon store car charger, too.im afraid ill never get to try it for myself, because he said he wants to keep it in his briefcase for traveling.  keeping bulk and weight down, while having equipment you can rely on, is important when you travel for a living  and hes giving the yubi usb car charger 5 stars.","i received a yubi power rapid usb car charger free from the vendor, in exchange for writing an honest review."

389,"i received my free sample case from unus utry program around two weeks ago, and i have to say im very impressed but a couple of minor things i dont like.the goodthe case the design is very well though out and excited. it fits the phone rather well while adding very little to the overall thickness of the phone. the sides of the case will be commented on shortly. the material used whatever kind of plastic it is is very nice and has help up well to some rather careless handling on my part. it doesnt feel cheap like some others i have felt. one of the design features that gets the most brownie points from me is the front of the case. the sides of the case hug the phone and they do not rise above the glass screen of the phone itself. which is awesome because i use the swipe left, swipe right to navigate in safari and i can actually do that because the sides dont get in my way. also, because of the way it holds on to the sides i didnt have to remove my screen protector.the external batter i have been very impressed with the back up battery on the phone. i did a little test myself, and actually caught my phone when it was at 2 and then used the back up battery alone... it fully charged my phone for me! it was great!!now for the badthe wireless charging pad this is one of the parts that i wasnt too fond of. it feels cheap, and i am afraid it is going to fall off my nightstand and break! also, where the usb cord connects to the wireless charging pad feels like it is going to break at some point. the other thing i dont like is the way the top part of the case attaches to the bottom part of the case. there isnt much that holds it together. i did drop the phone and the top part of the case did pop off. it snapped right back on but i feel that it is going to pop off again if i drop it.over all i would completely recommend this to anyone i know. it lets you charge your phone and has a backup battery with very little weight or thickness added to the phone! love it!!!","i received my free sample case from unus utry program around two weeks ago, and i have to say im very impressed but a couple of minor things i dont like."
689,"i received my maxboost 5600mah battery pack as a free sample for review.i have been using it for about a month by now. i have run through with several charges with my iphone5, my wife8217s samsung galaxy s5, my  mom8217s htc sensation. i have found maxboost portable battery is an excellent product with brilliant performance. with its 2.1a usb port, it changed all of my test cell phones iphone5, s5, htc sensation within an hour. for a 5600mah  prortable charger, it looks like the price is unbeatable. it tells how much mah is remaining in the battery which is a nice feature.to speak about its features, maxboost 5600mah battery pack can charge your android and apple devices multiple times. however, i did not test it with any windows or black berry cell phone or tablets. you can also charge an ipad or comparable tablet on a single charge. its twocharging ports to 5600mah battery is a value add as i could charge my iphone and my ipad at the same time. it tells how much power is remaining in the battery.this does take some time to charge, but in fairness, it is a 5600mah battery. i would advise to charge it overnight or at least give it about 4 to 5 hours to charge.in the end, the price and its performance are for impressive. i would definitely recommend this product.",i received my maxboost 5600mah battery pack as a free sample for review.
470,"i received my unu aero wireless charger via unus utry program. i chose the white case because i think white just looks more sleek. the package arrived very quickly and i was very eager to try it. their packaging is very nice with a open flap that reveals the case and some information on what the case does.the white is very nice. its shiny with a plastic feel that doesnt catch onto dust easily. i have a white iphone, so white on white isnt bad looking at all. it also doesnt collect fingerprints at all.the case itself is a little bulky compared to other cases well of course bc most do not come with a battery pack but compared to other battery cases ive used, this is on the bulkier side. the case is also a little longer than the iphone itself and makes it a little awkward to use. its longer on the bottom so it makes it hard to use headphones, but it comes with an extension cord which i misplaced the very first day. i usually just use the regular iphone headphones and it fits, but other headsets may have a harder time reaching the jack, so keep the extension cord in a safe place.i really liked the idea of having a wireless charging pad. the pad itself is a little small, and fits the case with not much extra room. but, i can just throw my phone onto the pad and it would start charging. it does charge a little slower, but thats not an issue since i charge my phone overnight anyways. when the phone battery is running low, you do have to remember to turn the battery on by holding the button on the case. if you forget, the battery wont charge and your phone would die. i havent really used the battery feature all too much since i dont do much on my phone, but the battery does work and charges seamlessly.overall, i think its a good case to try out if youre looking to extend your phones battery life. it is very convenient to place the phone on the charging pad, but charging a phone regularly is not a hassle.",i received my unu aero wireless charger via unus utry program
447,"i received my unu aero wireless charger via unus utry program. it does everything it says it does including the wireless charging pad. ive had other battery cases, but this is the first wireless pad.the case itself is very nice. i chose the black case and expected it to have the shiny plastic look. instead its actually a very matte black finish. it also has a soft touch which makes it easy to grip. the material doesnt collect finger prints but it does crete some friction when putting it in pockets.the case itself has many layers which i thought would make it bulky, but its actually thinner than i thought it would be. this probably has something to do w the sleek finish it has. its pretty thin for a battery case, but it is a littler longer than i expected. it sort of throws my phone off, but i can easily adjust to that. the length of the case does black the headphone jack, so it does come with a small extension cable that is a bit of a hassle to use. its a good thing i dont use headsets much.the idea of this case is to extend the battery life of your phone and it does just that. i usually start running out of battery midday and by the end of the day, im running to get my phone recharged before it dies. the case is a lifesaver. when im running low on battery, i just press the button on the case and itll start charging. it doesnt heat up like other cases which is awesome. ive used the case for a couple of weeks now and the case charges flawlessly each time. it charges rather quickly, and i wouldnt have to recharge my phone on the battery pad for at least 2 days. i really liked the led lights on the back that tells you if you need to charge soon. usually i dont wait until the last minute to recharge, but it does help to know.the charging dock is a very nice addition to the case. its a little small for the phone, but it still works. it makes everything a lot easier and no wire tangling. it definitely helps when you forget to plug your phone to charge.overall, i think this case is very handy and allows me to use my phone all day without worrying that by midday to recharge or let my phone die. the wireless charging pad is a nice touch that increases the convenience of charging.",i received my unu aero wireless charger via unus utry program
367,"i received my unu aero wireless charger via unus utry program. upon removal from the packaging, i noticed a very sleek looking case and charging pad. the black finish on the case really looks nice with my black iphone 5s. i installed the case and it felt snug on my phone. i plugged in the power pad, and set the phone on it. it immediately began to charge my phone. within an hour or so, my phone was at max charge and the case was fully charged as well. so far ive had no problems with either the case or the power pad. my phone is charged all day and when i get home i have no less than 65 battery on my phone. id say that this product lives up to its claims and is a very good option for iphone 5s owners, for both protection and battery life extension. i also like not having to physically plug my phone in every day. i can just set it on the pad on my dresser and it charges great. i would definitely recommend this product to every iphone 5s user.",i received my unu aero wireless charger via unus utry program.

236,"i received one of these units as part of a marketing campaign. i have had a few of these type of devices in the past the last one was a philips charger that had a built in 1000ma battery in it. while the philips product was convenient it fell short on giving you the needed power for more than a few minutes.i had reservations about the product but was very pleasantly surprised by its design and functionality. first off when you first look at it, it has the appearance of a cell phone. completely flat on one side with rounded edges on the back of it. the device is small in fact much smaller than my samsung s4 or even my older htc sensation. the unit features 2 usb ports. one standard full size female usb port where you can plug your devices power cord into the unit. along the bottom and on the side a small female mini usb connector that is used for charging the unit. comes with a charging cord.i like the size of the unit being only 516 thick its very comparable to most smart phones out there. i especially like that there are blue led bulbs that tell you when the unit is fully charged and power status.  charging the unit can be done with any usb power source, even a computer but using a computer will take a very long time for a full charge. i wish they offered a charger separately or perhaps a package were you could buy a unit and a charger together. for me, im a tech guy i have a drawer with something like 25 chargers in there but i could see where someone who only has a phone and maybe a tablet does not have a 1.5amp or higher charger to quickly power this up.operation, its a pretty simple device. i tested it using a samsung 10 galaxy note tablet. it definitely extends the battery. i plugged the unit into a completely dead tablet dead to where the screen auto dimmed and it easily allowed me to play for an hour with no problem. i thought it was cool that i was able to slide the unit behind the tablet within the two cases we use and even though having a cord sticking out of the bottom of the tablet was a bit annoying the fact that it allowed continued use made up for it.i just started testing the unit on a samsung s4. i generally like to do a decently indepth look at a product so those results will be posted as updates to this review within a few weeks.so how many stars?i gave the unit 4 stars. now normally i stay away from giving a product 4 or 5 stars as i think that a product that does what it says it will do  is really a 3 star product. and in order to get that coveted 4 or 5 stars the product really needs to wow! you something most products just dont do.does it meet expectations?

629,"i received the maxboost 10000mah battery pack as a free sample for review and to share my experience of the product. ill start off with the pros. i like the fact that it has a flashlight for emergencies, can charge two devices at once, shows battery pack power percentage, cuts off itself after one minute of nonuse, cuts itself on when usb is put into battery pack, charges iphone 5s quickly, and tells when device is done charging fully charged. the battery pack takes hours to charge my ipad. after four to five hours i just unplugged my ipad from the battery pack and charged it to my computer. the battery pack itself charges slow and it does the weirdest thing. when i tried to charge my iphone and charge the battery pack at the same time it stopped my iphone from charging while it charged itself. then, when i was charging my ipad, the battery pack and iphone, it still stopped my iphone form charging but continued to charge itself and my ipad. after, my iphone finished charging i unplugged it while my ipad continued to charge and i plugged in the usb to charge the battery pack but that time it stopped my ipad from charging. that was very weird to me. lastly the size of the battery pack should be smaller. there are many battery packs that are smaller and not embarrassing to take out during a meeting, class, or anything else of that nature. the battery pack has potential, but isnt quite there yet.",i received the maxboost 10000mah battery pack as a free sample for review and to share my experience of the product.
576,"i received the maxboost 15000mah battery pack as a free sample for review and to share my experience of the product. right our of the box i noticed that it was heavier than the other battery packs i own. however, it could be done to the extra power that it is holding. the next thing i noticed flashlight for emergencies, it came in handy when i went camping one weekend. it has two usb ports to charge two devices at once. once of the best features on the battery pack is the battery life shown in percentage. im so used to most battery packs just showing 4 to 5 led light indicators showing how full they are. with the percentage it a nice change. since it is a big battery pack, it does take about 5 to 6 hours to change up fully. the only thing i would change about this product would to add an extra usb port. battery packs that i own that are 10000mah and up usually have three changing ports. best eye catching features would be the flashlight and numeric percentage. overall this is a great usb portable external battery.",i received the maxboost 15000mah battery pack as a free sample for review and to share my experience of the product.
600,"i received the maxboost as a free sample for reviewing purposes. upon arrival the device was almost completely loaded 98, which enabled me to put it to the test immediately. the device has to outlets for charging, one of them a 5v 2.1a, the other 5v 1.0a. also it is recommended to charge most cell phones with the 1.0a outlet, it doesnt do any harm to your cellphonecellphone battery to charge it with the 2.1v outlet. my first test for this device was actually charging 2 iphones at the same time. i have to say i was very satisfied with the performance of the maxboost for this test. both iphones were at 100 capacity within 1 12 hours and the maxboost still had almost 50 of charging capacity left after that.the maxboost comes with 3 cable attachments, one for iphone 4s or lower, one for iphone 5 and most other popular android devices. the third attachment can be used to charge the device itself.  the maxboost can either be charged by connecting it to a usb slot at your computer, or by wall outlet with a usbcompatible wall plug. the wall plug, however, is not included in the maxboost package. even so this would be a nice to have item, it is not really a problem that it is not included, as most cell phones and tablets come with an usb compatible wall plug, and these plugs can easily be used to charge the maxboost at a wall outlet. overall i am very impressed with the maxboost. the digital display is a very convenient, userfriendly feature, its charging capacity before it needs a recharge itself is very impressive. its compact form makes it easy to store it in any computer bag, but it also comes with a nice and stable pouch so the device itself and all accessories can easily be carried and stored just in this pouch. if you are on the lookout for a high quality external battery pack for your  cell phone or tablet, the maxboost is the perfect device. you can be sure to get the bang for your bucks with this device. had i not be lucky enough to receive this device for free for review purposes, it would still be the external battery pack of my choice.",i received the maxboost as a free sample for reviewing purposes.
580,"i received the maxboost battery pack for free to put it to the test i was not required to write a positive review, but it passed with flying colors! i do a lot of gaming on my droid and i use it to listen to music stream videos and i usually do all e mails through it so it dies a lot! i have bought quite a few different batter packs to try to help with this issue and for the most part they do not give the time they say they will and they just do not work well overall and break quickly. this is not the case with maxboost. there are quite a few things i love about this battery pack. first it is sturdy and i love the look of it overall it can fit into just about anything. it has an amazing flash light. this is great for those of us who lose them every time we buy them. this is always with me and some might say to use the one on my phone well then it dies. not only that this light is super bright. good for showing the kids that monsters do not live in the closet or under the bed, or finding the random things that fall into the bermuda triangle in my carunder the seat lol.now onto the really good stuff. this thing powers like no other.i was skeptical but not anymore with the maxboost batter pack i have seen the light, literally. the charging power of the pack is amazing. when it says 50 extra hours of game play or 40 extra hours of talk time it means it.i always make sure it is charged and i do not leave the house without it. i was worried after using it a couple times the batter life would be shortened or it would break but none of that. it works just as great the 30th time as it did the first. this is something that could literally save your life. i love having the assurance that if something happens and no one is around and my phone is dead i can plug it in and it is good to go. it is great for camping and travelling and a whole host of activities. oh did i mention tablets, this thing can do it all and it really does what it says. it is so simple to use and easy to understand. i am getting them for my mom and sister and husband it really has made my life that much easier now that i dont have to worry every time i am out somewhere or someone has my kids and my phone is dying that if something happens they cant get a hold of me. you really should give it a try it will change the way you think about battery packs!",i received the maxboost battery pack for free to put it to the test

515,"i received the sharkk bluetooth 4.0 headphones wireless stereo inear earbuds rechargeable headset with volume control and microphone this past week. i wanted to spend a little time with them before presenting my review. i was provided a free sample of this product from the good folks at sharkk for a fair, unbiased and honest review.the first thing you8217ll notice is the packaging in which the earbuds are shipped in. a clear plastic package that is relatively simple to open and remove the earbuds from. no clamshell package here, and to use scissors to open it is a risk you shouldn8217t need to take. now the earbuds themselves are a glossy black color which are attached to a thin, flat, black cable that runs between both ear pieces which incorporates the power button,  as well as the volume 82208221 and volume 822082118220 buttons. the charging port and microphone are both located on the earbud marked 8220r8221 the right side you8217ll also find that the inline volume control and power switch are nearer the right side earbud. the design of the earbuds is fairly simplistic, practical and usable. the sharkk bluetooth inear earbuds with microphone and volume control come with an array of different styled ear tip pieces which mount easily and securely to your earbuds. having a small ear canal i opted for the small round pieces which fit comfortably and without worry of falling out while i run, or bicycle.the earbuds are easy to adapt to and they don8217t hurt your ears after prolonged use. if you8217re one of those people who dislike earbuds because they generally cause pain while being used, then this is a viable option for you. the sharkk bluetooth inear earbuds with microphone and volume control are lightweight less than an ounce!, responsive to commands, and works for phone calls. however the microphone isn8217t quite as good as i had hoped for, so make sure that you8217re in a quiet place if you plan to use these earbuds for phone calls. the sound quality of the phone calls is very good, on par with many bluetooth devices which are created specifically for phone calls.audio quality of the sharkk bluetooth inear earbuds with microphone and volume control can be described as very good, but not fantastic. however these are small, bluetooth, and more than sufficient for most people looking at this type of listening device. if you want higher quality sound then be prepared to spend in excess of 100. the highs are very high and the lows are kind of 8220just there8221 while the midrange is not bad. the sound in an overall experience is very good. i sampled these with everything from country to reggae, metal, rap, top 40, classical, bbc news, etc. and was not disappointed in the overall sound quality. the headphones are loud enough to be heard while running and bicycling, the wind noise is almost zero.i compared these to a pair of wired, marshmallow earbuds which have an impressive frequency response range, the sharkk bluetooth inear earbuds while having no indicator of the frequency response range held up pretty well against my expensive wired earbuds until the volume test. obviously you don8217t use earbuds to make yourself deaf from loud music, but a little more volume out of the sharkk bluetooth inear earbuds wouldn8217t be a bad thing.so the breakdown for the sharkk bluetooth 4.0 headphones wireless stereo inear earbuds rechargeable headset with volume control and microphone is very favorable. the transmitting distance of the bluetooth function was over 50 feet with a clear lineofsight this means don8217t cover the earbuds, or walk around a corner and the battery life is impressive too. the earbuds come with an instruction manual which does an excellent job explaining how to use the functions of your new wireless bluetooth earbuds from sharkk.overall impression1. function 4 stars2. design 5 stars3. ease of useinstallation 5 stars4. durability 5 stars5. price unrated at this time, no information available. i will amend this as soon as the price is made available.overall the sharkk bluetooth 4.0 headphones wireless stereo inear earbuds rechargeable headset with volume control and microphone score a solid 4.5 out of 5 stars. if the volume can be made a little louder and the microphone more receptive then you have a solid 5 star product."," i was provided a free sample of this product from the good folks at sharkk for a fair, unbiased and honest review."

419,"i received the unu aero seri.es iphone 5s battery case for free from unu for review.the case came packaged with a usb micro cable, an earphone extension cable, and a charging pad. the case consists of 2 parts, battery with lightning connector and a bumper style case. i found that a bit peculiar, i was expecting something similar to a previous case i recently reviewed unu power dx external protective battery case for iphone 5s, httpwww.amazon.compowerexternalprotectivebatteryiphonedpb00b1uqd7mrefsr_1_3?ieutf8qid1391452275sr83keywordsunubatterycase . i am not a big fan of bumper style cases. the first case i received was defective, the parts did not snap together properly. after a short email to unu, a replacement was on its way. the replacement case snapped fine no problem.the design is simple, slide the phone into a sled style battery case, and snap over it the bumper. the battery will only activate after you push and hold the button on the back,  you can not discharge the battery accidentally. you get about 80 charge on a full battery.the case feels good in your hand, the matt rubber case makes for a good grip.an opening for the earphones makes easily accessible, you can always use the included extension if your earphones dont fit. my beats fit just fine.the charging process is straightforward, you can either plug in a micro usb cable into the case or rest the case on the included pad. you get good contacts almost 100 of the time. a tiny blue led on the pad glows to let you know the case is charging, not too bright to be annoying, but the led is close to the usb connector, therefor most of the time facing away from you, hard to tell if its charging. the pad is really light, and can travel easily.i use my phone extensively at work, and i appreciate the wireless charging, when i walk in my office i just have to rest the phone on the pad to juice it a little bit.you can not talk about this case without comparing it to the duracell powercell wireless case. for a starter, the duracell case is an eyesore, i can not believe that anyone would design such an ugly product, let alone buy it to use with the iphone  httpwww.amazon.comduracellpowermatwirelesschargingiphone5blackdpb00cirllewrefsr_1_8?ieutf8qid1391453034sr88keywordsduracellpowercellcaseiphone . second the duracell case is clumsy and flimsy, and heavy with battery attached. true the duracell uses induction wireless charging, the unu uses contacts, still they achieve the same goal. duracell needs a separate pad for travel, the cost increases by the time you add the cost of the case, battery, pad and travel pad. and lastly, the duracell needs to be positioned almost perfectly on the pad to charge. the duracell pad however has a better implantation of the charging led.i let my teenage son use the case, he did like it and felt it was truly the lightest of the batter cases hes tried, including few mopes and unu and other cases.i think unu has a good product on their hands. i would recommend the case to a friend.",received the unu aero seri.es iphone 5s battery case for free from unu for review.

613,"i received this as a free sample from maxboost.  i was very skeptical but i must admit, i really like it.  i has already been very useful and i like the little pouch to carry it around.  it comes with a few different tips to charge different devices but i just used my own iphone 5 charger and used it to recharge my ipad mini and my iphone 5.  i got a few full charges out of the pack before i had to recharge it.  it took a while to recharge but thats probably because it holds so much.  its bigger than i expected but not too big that its really weighing down my purse or anything.  nice size.  overall, i am quite pleased with this device.",i received this as a free sample from maxboost.
635,"i received this as a free sample in return for my review.i personally loved this product.  i get a little bit of anxiety if my battery on my phone starts getting too low, and i know im not the only one.  this external power source eliminates that anxiety because i know that i now have a back up.  the device itself is a little bulky, but i think for the purpose it serves, and the power it holds, it cant really be smaller.i wanted to gauge just what kind of time it took to provide a charge, so i the battery on my iphone 5s get down to 20 in order to test it out.  i charged it for 45 minutes and it got me up to 60 battery life and drained the external about 15.  i liked that, a decent amount of charge fairly quickly.  i did notice that in order to charge the source up, it does take a little longer, but leave it plugged in over night and you should be fine.it is a dual ampage charger, and i have only used the lower volt to charge my phone, as recommended, and havent tested it out on one of my tablets, but with the performance on the phone, i would imagine that it works just as well with a tablet.",i received this as a free sample in return for my review.
976,"i received this as a review sample and have a few other models to which i can compare it. the first thing i noticed when i configured it is its quick. i have an older quad core and two dual core models that i would not consider good game boxes, but this one is.before getting into my take on this box, i want to set expectations. this is not a general consumer tv box. its designed for folks who are advanced android users and are comfortable with some of the more technical aspects of networking and that operating system. the manual is terse and clearly written for that audience.although its a turnkey solution with respect to coming with a remote, hdmi able and power supply, i strongly advise you to invest in a mouse and keyboard. the remote is an exercise in frustration. i plugged a wireless not bluetooth keyboard and mouse in via a dongle and they were immediately recognized and functional. i did experience the same issue with capitalizing letters that rob slaven cited in his june 24, 2014 review, and that is the sole reason why i awarded this four stars. once that issue is fixed i will upgrade this review.what i love, aside from the speed, is this can be expanded into a relatively sophisticated android computer. or you can use it as a streaming video player and occasional web browsing box. basically, if you can access and run a service from your android phone or tablet, you and download the same app for that service to this box and run it. right now i am playing around with some music apps on mine and a few games, and with my keyboard and mouse its easy to use. most of my streaming is from youtube, which is seamless with this box, and pandora for music.if you have a legacy tv with composite av inputs you can still use this because it has a 3.5mm to composite rca connector labeled av. you can use this or a similar cable if your tv does not support hdmiaudiovideo av 3.5mm to 3rca 5ft composite cable.another reason why i like this box is its running the 4.4.2 os, which is the same as my samsung galaxy note 3. the user interfaces are very different between the two, but everything that i run on my phone runs perfectly on this box and i have tested my third party apps to verify that.bottom line if you love tinkering with technology and are comfortable with the inner workings of the android os, this is a great platform for not only streaming to your tv, but running other apps. if you are a developer this is a perfect qa and release candidate platform. finally, if you are a geek who is holding on to an old tv and want to connect something cooler than a dvd or vhs player, youll have a ball with this.",received this as a review 
626,"i received this as a sample from maxboost and i must say this is amazing. i love the lcd display which is easy to understand and the fact that i can charge 2 devices at once. i no longer need to have a bulky case on my iphone 5 since when the external battery is at 100 it takes 15 to charge my phone from 5 to 100 in about an hour and a half. the carrying pouch and included adapters make it nearly impossible to lose anything. the external battery charges overnight from 10 to 100. ive used the super bright torch to look for things in dark areas. let me say this is topnotch quality and would recommend this to anyone. no more car chargers as wherever i go i know that i have a reliable battery. not convinced? well how about the beautiful design that makes it easy to slip in and out of pocket easily, or the blue display making for easy reading. i personally love the battery and expect to keep using it for as long as i have a smartphoneforever",i received this as a sample from maxboost and i must say this is amazing

270,"i received this at no cost in exchange for writing a review. this is not something i would buy on my own. heres why.1. this isnt much more powerful than a 34lipstick34 charger, which is much more compact than this unit.update dec. 7, 2013. although this is rated as having an output of 2.1a, another review points out that in fact this charges at only 1a. i confirmed this because this unit will not charge my ipad. so the 2.1a output listing is deceptive and meaningless.3. i agree with other reviews that the design on the back is not only ugly but deceptive. there is a flag logo that says 34designed for america34 yet the product is made in china. the name of the company and this logo try to create the misleading impression that somehow the manufacture or design of this product is connected to america, which it is not. i find that personally offensive.a second deception is the picture on amazon, which shows an orange back with a logo and some technical symbols only. but the unit i received had a white back that contained a 34billboard34 with all kinds of writing, including a solicitation for a review. i dont carry around 34billboards34 for companies.the seller sent me an email that the 34billboard34 version i received was a 34review version34 but that what is pictured on amazon is what purchasers receive. but i can review only what i am sent.4. if you want a very sleek and attractive, not to mention more powerful and versatile, charger for your iphone that is not much larger than this product, try the easyacc 5000mah 2.5a dual port fast charging ultraslim portable external battery charger pack powerbank. it works great.5. if you want a compact charger that will charge an ipad, try the gadgets 8400mah external portable battery pack charger , which is amazingly compact for such a powerful charger.note when i tried to reply to the email that the seller sent me, i found out no responses could be sent to that email address. that always makes me suspicious. i would avoid this seller. and if you believe the 349999 days warranty34, then i have a bridge in brooklyn that you might like to buy.update december 10, 2013 i lowered my rating from three stars to two stars after reading another review that extensively tested this unit and confirmed that not only is the 2.1a output false, but so is the overall claim for how this unit charges. i also note that one or more persons is negging the critical reviews on this product. please read those critical reviews carefully before you decide to order a product that simply doesnt live up to its promises.update december 12, 2013 i recently received the arctic power bank 4000 ultraslim 2.0a output 4000mah backup batterycharger for tablet and phone  black. its everything a compact charger should be and that this 5 star product is not. accordingly i have lowered my rating to one star.",i received this at no cost in exchange for writing a review.

244,"i received this battery pack in red to provide an honest review. id describe the color as a neon reddish pink with a matching flatribbon micro usb charging cable. the external battery charger looks like my ipod touch 4g, but is slightly thicker. it is  the lightest battery pack ive used, making it great to toss in my purse.the external battery charger didnt come with instructions. it has 3 led lights. two were lit, one  was blinking when i recd the charger for reviewing purposes. so i charged it using the included usb cable before using it the first time. after it was charged, i charged my kindle fire hd with the 5 star america external battery charger. it ran out of power before my kindle was completely charged. so, i repeated the process.  this battery pack has 2 usb ports. the 5v1.5a input port is used to charge the battery pack the 5v2.1a output port, is used to charge your device.the 5 star america external battery charger is thin  lightweight. great for having on hand for those times when you dont have access to a power source.  if your device doesnt support a micro usb, dont forget to pack the one your device uses. supplying 3100mah, it might not fully charge your device, but should supply enough power to make your device usable.9999 day warranty a little over 27 years",i received this battery pack in red to provide an honest review
206,"i received this battery pack in return for my fair review. there are a lot of chargers available now, and with the amount of portable devices, they are almost becoming a necessity.  they all do basically the same thing  charge your device when you dont have power available.the 2 things that set this apart are size and price.  it is about the size of a small cell phone  very thin and easy to carry.  the color is attractive, with a black glass face and matching color interface cord.  this is one of the heaviest duty cords i have seen.  some people have mentioned the logo, but i didnt pay much attention to that.there are 3 lights hidden in the cover that indicate a full charge.  they only show up when plugged in.  after a full charge, i was able to charge my samsung galaxy from 21 to a full charge and still have 2 lights showing.  i used it a second time without recharging it.  it brought my phone from 11 to 91 before it stopped charging.  that was better than i had expected from such a small unit.the 2 cons are a lack of documentation you really dont need much with no moving parts, and the fact that you cant tell how much it is charged without plugging it in. for the price, it is a real bargain  much nicer quality than i expected.",i received this battery pack in return for my fair review.

202,"i received this device in exchange for a review.i have now received four external battery devices from different companies with the agreement that i give them feedback on their product. of the four, i am the least enthused over this 5 star america charger. a few positives first the device is very attractive thin, small, and resembles an ipod touch. at 13.99 the price is definitely affordable. it works, albeit slowly.overall, i am not very impressed. the 5 star america name with an american flag logo would imply that it is an american company, and that the device made in america. not only is this device made in china, but packaging includes a document that appears to be chinese. furthermore, a google search cannot find this company and the website listed on the back of the unit does not appear to exist.functionally it works okay. i charged my phone from 48 to 100 in about 2 hrs. i let it run down again to 50 and charged to only 91 before the unit itself ran out of juice. at 3100mah, it should be good for a few charges. the device also boasts of a 2a output, which should charge an ipad, my other devices with these specs charge my ipad very well. this unit will not charge my ipad at all. the ipad does not go down in charge, but does not rise. now the company has removed it8217s claim that it will charge an ipad, but i highly suspect that the 2.1a output with 3100mah to be false.so in summery, this device will charge an ipod or a smart phone, but speed tests between my other chargers leave this device in the dust. again, at 13.99, i guess you get what you pay for. but for my needscamping, overseas travel, and remote areas with limited access to power, i wouldn8217t mind spending a bit more for a quality charger that will be good for more than one reserve boost.",i received this device in exchange for a review.
274,"i received this external battery charger for review from 5 star america recently. i put it through some paces on my iphone 4, and heres what i experienced with it...powerwise 3100 mah, i was able to get the equivalent of one full recharge with a small bit left over on my iphone. in 70 minutes of charging, i went from 22 to 91, which is right around the minuteperpercent that i usually look for. i then used it again to go from 60 to 93 in 40 minutes later on. the power bar lights went from three fully charged down to one. my guess is that there wasnt much juice left in it.in terms of design, its very light and different than most chargers. its made to look like a very thin smart phone, and you could be forgiven for thinking it was one on first glance. the front on mine is a black glossy surface again, like a smart phone thats turned off, but it doesnt have any touch functions on it other than to collect fingerprints. the normal usb slot is on the bottom edge, with the microusb slot on the side at the bottom. the provided microusb cord is a flat cord which looks and feels very sturdy. the main use would be to charge the battery with the microusb plug. there are no other cords or plug adapters provided, so you have to make sure you have your own in those cases like for a lightning connector. i didnt try it out on my ipad to test out the 2.1a output, but i did plug it in to make sure it was compatible without any errors. my feeling would be that it wouldnt due a good job of recharging the ipad, but it would slow down the drain if plugged in during use.probably the main negative of this unit is the text in the skimpy documentation and on the back of the unit. the backside of the battery is covered with logos and text pointing you to amazon to write a review. ive seen some people say that the company says the review units are different than 34retail34 units in terms of whats on the back, but either way its a bit much. im also not thrilled with the emphasis on america in the company name, ad copy, etc... while its actually manufactured in china. 34designed for america34 does not mean 34made in america34.bottom line... this is a decent external battery pack for 34just in case34 use. ill make sure to keep it charged up and in my charger collection in the event of a prolonged power outage. the whole 34designed for america34 and repeated pointers to leave amazon reviews leaves a lessthanwonderful emotional impression on me, and that knocks it down a notch for me.disclosureobtained from manufacturerpayment free",disclosureobtained from manufacturerpayment free

977,"i received this free for the purposes of review but ill still be absolutely honest about it below. quick setup plug it in and its as good as ready to go. navigation is exceptionally difficult. interface supported by the provided remote control allows you to move a pointer very slowly around the screen and click on things. this is profoundly cumbersome. luckily, you can connect a bluetooth mouse and keyboard. no problem with the mouse once connected but even with the keyboard there are bizarre software issues. for example, to get a capital letter you cant just hit shift on the connected keyboard. you have to use the mouse to click the shift key on the onscreen keyboard and then type. lord help you if youve chosen the chinese keyboard which is the default option the provided instruction manual 18 pages english, 18 pages chinese is extremely unhelpful. it is essentially, just screenshots and brief descriptions of the screens. no real help on navigation or usage.in summary, as something i received for free its interesting and powerful. id be pretty annoyed if id paid for it, however. i suspect that with a bit of practice it could be pretty handy but i think well stick with our existing options for video.",i received this free for the purposes of review but ill still be absolutely honest about it below.
500,"i received this free product for testing and to provide my unbiased opinion.the sharkk bluetooth 4.0 headphones wireless stereo inear earbuds come in a clear, hard plastic package, which i cut my finger on by opening the package. after i removed the earbunds, i connected them to their charging jack which has a usb cable and connected them to my computer to charge them. the earbuds came with a decent charge, so it only took about 15 minutes for them to charge the rest of the way. after i charged them, i connected them via bluetooth to my iphone 4s and it was a very easy process. i noticed that the earbuds have a rubber piece that keeps them snugly in my ear which was a nice surprise. the disappointment came once i played music from my iphone. the sound was very one dimensional. there was no distinct bass only treble. i compared them to my stock earbuds that came with my iphone just to check, and the stock earbuds produce a richer sound. it is difficult to change the volume because i had to take out the right earbud where the volume control is because it is so close to my head and therefore i cannot see the controls. if the sound was richer and fuller and if the volume control was lower down from my head, the earbuds would improve significantly.",i received this free product for testing and to provide my unbiased opinion.

431,"i received this iphone battery case as a free test product.  i was not required to give a positive review, just my own honest review of the product.i choose the white case and i love how its so bright and shiny! i read that the black case is more of a rubberized feel, which is also nice, but i do so like my shiny white case.  i really havent had any problem with holding onto the phone, though when my husband picked it up, he thought it was slippery.  i tend to be more careful with my electronic toys, so i have not dropped it, and cannot attest to how protective the case would be if dropped.  i also tend to place my phone facing up, rather than screen facing down, and i dont notice any major scratching on the case so far.  there is a small lip on the front to hold the screen a tiny bit above the surface if you do lay it screen down, though i wouldnt mind seeing a bit more lip edge, and possibly with a bit of rubberized feel to it to hold it in place.  perhaps the black case does this.  the white is just plastic and can be considered somewhat slippery.i have never used a battery case til now, so i have nothing to compare it to in that regard.  this is also my first iphone, and i was experiencing loss of battery life at an alarming rate.  i did find a way to extend the life by turning off some features, but adding this battery case is really awesome!  now i dont feel that i have to conserve the battery to make it last throughout the whole day, and i really like that whole feature.  i wish they made this for the ipad!  or do they??as others have noted, it does add some weight and length to your phone, and a bit of width.  it hasnt bothered me so far, and its not really bulky at all.  i carry it in a purse when i am out, and if i needed to fit it in a smaller pocket, i would probably just take it out of the case for awhile.  i have not tried to take the case off, but i dont think it would be a huge problem.i love the charging base..its so easy to set the phone down onto the base to allow it to charge.  i dont have to fiddle around trying to stick the charger into the little hole, although that is also an option!  just plug it into any mini usb cable.  the cable that comes in the box to use with the charging base isnt very long.  i have it plugged into my computer and it sits on the desk fine.  but if i were using a wall plug to set it onto a table or dresser, it might be on the short side.  i believe its 3 ft.  you can pick one up anywhere, and you can also purchase additional charging bases, though its small and flat and could be taken along on a trip very easily.i havent priced other battery cases, but i think this is probably comparable at the 80 range.  it is a nice product for those of us who use the phone away from a changing station for many hours each day.  this gives you the confidence that you will not have a dead battery just when you need your phone.  im very pleased to have been given this opportunity to try this product.",i received this iphone battery case as a free test product.
289,"i received this item as a free testing sample from the companys utry promotion. this promotion provides the product but we reviewers provide the review.  this review is my honest review and has not been influenced in any way by the company nor was i required to provide a positive review.first, this is my second product from the company.  i previously bought the unu power dx external protective battery case for iphone 5s before receiving this product. while you might think this is overkill to own to external batteries, i recently retired from the military and spend a long time traveling or waiting to travel now.  if you will be on a long trip that lasts about 24 hrs, both products will get you through, but this one will likely cover the entire period if you use your iphone moderately or less.second. while my product spec sheet received from the company via email stated 5,000mah, here on amazon the other reviews state the product is rated at 4,400mah while the product information on amazon does not clearly state what it is rated at.  i am not sure which is correct, but will go with the lower number just in case. approximately 45 of a star is removed for this problem.third, this device comes with its own well integrated usb to micro usb cable. that is awesome. and, because the micro usb fits their my power dx external backpack battery, it just works well.fourth. because i own their power dx, i expect that their products would have similar buttons and lights  indicators.  nope!  the power dx has a light that shows various colors to indicate the state of charge, green  blue  red.  this product, the enerpak flexi portable has a round button surrounded by dotted lights.  nearly every other review describes the lights somewhat differently than what i have.  maybe they received something different.  my device has a round button to turn the device on.  on the outside of the button are three sets of three dotlike lights.  if you counted them it would be 9 dots, but that is not how the lights are meant to be read.  think of the 3 dots as contiguous and therefore you have three indicator lights. also, the lights are only one color, blue and do not turn different colors to indicate their state of charge. so, if you think if the dots as one light, here is what the company faq describes their state of charge3 lights 100  662 lights  about 65  331 solid light  about 32  21 light flashing  about 1if you took that literally counting all the dots, it may not look correct.  again, count the three dot set as one light and this makes sense.i took off about 65 of a star because of this discrepancy, this products charge indication lights should be uniform to how their other products indicate their state of charge.last. i really do enjoy this product.  it provides that extra cushion of battery power i need when traveling and the ability to charge my phone next to me rather than leave my phone on the counter to charge. while not the largest battery on the market, it is a great addition to my phone charging toolbox! would i purchase this item?  yes, the flexible integrated cord that wraps around the device sets this device apart from the competition and makes it well worth the purchase.",i received this item as a free testing sample from the companys utry promotion.
246,"i received this item free in exchange for a review of the product.  i found that it works well to charge my phone, but struggles to charge my tablet.  i am not sure why this is  but it seems to work ok with smaller devices.  i was hoping this would work with my phone and tablet, especially for travel  but it is good if you are just looking for an additional charge for your phone.  i wouldnt buy this myself only because i would like something that was multifunctional and i also dont like that it is made in china.  i normally try to only buy made in the u.s.a. products as often as i can.",i received this item free in exchange for a review of the product.
207,"i received this item free to test and review.i have tested quite a number of these storagebackup batteries and most look just what they are and purely functional but this was very stylish looking almost like a small mobile phone one side being very shiny piano black and the rest of the case white with the 5 america logo on it. once charged up it fitted nicely in my phone case together with the phone. in fact i had to use it quicker than i expected to as i had to suddenly go out, grabbed my phone and forgot it needed conveniently the charging cable that comes with the battery standard usb one end and micro usb at the other  also doubles as a cable to charge a phone. remember if your phone is not micro usb you will need to take the appropriate lead.using is simplicity itself just plug the charging lead into a convenient  charger and wait until all three blue leds light up when it is fully charged. to use it to charge a phone or similar 5v device just plug a lead into the output and the device and the leds indicating the charge level come on. there are no switches which is actually very helpful as i have other batteries which turn off if load is not being drawn this is a nuisance if you are powering a torch which you are going to turn on and off.all this coupled with the 9999 days guarantee, actually in the leaflet it states lifetime makes it an excellent battery as the expected life of this type of battery is usually given as 500 chargedischarge cycles.so far so good.however the manufacturers  suppliers have done themselves no favours as the review versions seem to have loads of printing over the white side which is not shown on the photographs of the product description. there are customer images showing what i mean, i tried to upload mine but i have no idea where it has gone, something that is easier on the uk site and if this is the retail version i would be less impressed with the style. i also do not know why there are 10 logos showing everything from ce compliance required in the eu to do not set fire plus a few i had no idea what they are, in fact too cluttered.the other thing that would have helped were some instructions although not exactly difficult to use there are 3 leds and i assumed that the indicated a 13rd of a charge each. i hope this is not the case as when i got it, it showed two leds on and it took almost 5 hours to charge using a 1.5a charger and the supplied charging lead. on the case there is a web address to find out about charging instructions etc, unfortunately this only goes to the 5 star america home pages and no charging instructions.in summary an excellent, small and stylish backup battery that has a lot going for it but needs more support from the manufacturers.psi am in the uk and we find it just as difficult to buy anything that is made in our country, this despite clever labelling designed for america is actually of chinese manufacture.",i received this item free to test and review.

665,"i received this maxboost electron 5600mah as a free sample from their vipu program. when i opened up the package, it was already at 100 charge. what i immediately noticed though, was that the lcd screen was already burning out. the 100 still was visible but the in out 5.0v 2.1a and 5.0v 1.0a was already fading. one huge problem was when i tried plugging the mini usb in to charge the device, the prongs were broken so i needed to use my own micro usb cable.  when my phone died, i immediately started charging it. as soon as i plugged the charger into my phone it immediately drop from 100 to 88 in a matter of seconds. it took about 2 hours to charge from absolutely 0 to 100 leaving the external charger at 15. my phone is 2800mah. so i was hoping to get a charge and a half at least. the last 15 did pack a punch and did charge my phone again to about 50 so in total it can charge my galaxy s5 1.5 times. this external charger has lived up to its expectations and i absolutely love it for when im on the go and super busy throughout my day.size 4.0 x 1.7 x 0.8 inch weight 4.3 ouncepros small and compactcons only charges my phone galaxy s5 1.5 times",i received this maxboost electron 5600mah as a free sample from their vipu program.
684,"i received this maxboost electron mini portable external battery as a free sample from maxboost. to give my honest review and opinion provided to the public.ive used this product for a month now. its a glossy black design. its pretty small and easy to get lost. the maxboost electron mini also has a nice blue l.e.d. screen. it is very easy to read and see. it also came with a small 3 inch micro usb cable to charge the device and also to use the maxboost electron mini on any micro usb capable phone or electronic device. it also has a bright l.e.d. flashlight built in on the top of the device. this has been very handy in a vehicle to find something or when you lose your keys.to charge the maxboost electron mini. you simply need a micro usb cable or the 3 inch micro usb cable that is provided with the device. plug the micro usb cable in to the micro usb port on the top of the device. you can either plug it into a computer, a usb car charger, or usb wall charger. once you decided your power source. the device will light up and it will flash in on the screen. if you notice the device is getting warm to the touch. stay calm. this is normal for the device to get warm as it charges the 5600mah battery. i was kinda worried at first. the more i used the maxboost electron mini. the more i came to a understanding this was normal. depending on the power source you use. the device can take a several hours to fully charge. 4 hours on a laptop and about 3 hours on a usb car charger. tapping the power button on the right hand side will light up the display so you can see the charging percentage.once you have the device fully charged. this is how you can play with your sleek and sophisticated device. pushing the power button will turn the device on with a lit display. double tapping the power button will the turn on the super bright l.e.d. flashlight. holding the power button down will shut the device off. pretty simple to use, so simple a baby can use it. i would not recommend a baby using this though for you and your babies protection.now on to using your handy device and getting to the point of why this device will aid you. i have a samsung galaxy s5. ive been able to charge my phone twice on this. even though the s5 has been improved then all other previous galaxy models. my phone can last up to 3 days without being charged. 2 days if i play with it lightly. to simply charge your device with the maxboost electron mini. you need to flip your micro usb cable around and plug the usb end onto the port  on top of the device. then plug the micro usb cable into your phone, tablet, etc. once plugged in your phone, tablet, etc. will start charging immediately and the maxboost electron mini will light up displaying out on the screen. it will tell you the rate its charging. either 5.0v 2.1a or 5.0v 1.0a. it will also show you how much percentage of the battery life left is. then the light for the screen will automatically shut off to conserve power. just tap the power button for it to light back up. once your device is charged. unplug it immediately so you can save power on your maxboost electron mini.now if you think the electron mini would not be useful for you. think again! because this device will save you from a power outage up to a day or two. take it with you on a fishing trip or camping trip where there is no power. if you do not have a flashlight handy. whip this puppy out to help you tie up the hook for that next big fish. to find your long lost keys to get into your house or vehicle. this little device has been a pleasure to have and ill always look forward to using it in the future.",i received this maxboost electron mini portable external battery as a free sample from maxboost.

438,"i received this product as a free sample in exchange for writing a review for it. the views expressed are my own honest opinions of this product, for better or for worse.aesthetics  feelif you prefer a more rounded case as opposed to the rectangular iphone form factor that apple has adopted since the iphone 4, you8217ll like this. it has a similar feel to the old iphone 3g3gs form factors, with smoothed edges. i personally have mixed feelings about this, because it does feel sleeker and slimmer, but it also makes it difficult to prop up on its side against anything for handsfree viewing of media. overall, the case is of pretty sound construction and the bumper fits snugly around the phone on all sides. one minor though though was that the cover on the bumper that goes over the sleep button somehow snapped off at some point during the first couple weeks of testing this unit, even though i never dropped it. this makes it a little more difficult to push the sleep button but the rest of the bumper is still intact.chargingthere are two ways to charge the phone, directly with the microusb cable on the bottom side of the case, or using the contact points on the back of the phone and the wireless charging pad, which also has a microusb port. the wireless charging is very convenient if you8217re the type of person who can set your phone down and not touch it for several hours. if you8217re the kind of person who tends to use your phone while it charges, you won8217t find much utility in the wireless charging feature, because the case has to be flush against the charging pad in order for it to continuously charge. your other alternative, of course, is to remove the bumper and take the phone out of the case while it charges, but that is also less convenient. my only real complaint about charging is that there8217s no way to check the progress of the charge without removing the phone from the charging pad, because the lights that indicate the charge level are on the back side of the case. if you are charging it through the microusb port, this isn8217t an issue, but on the charging pad you can8217t see the lights during the charge.dischargingthe specs indicate that this case has a 2000mah battery, and i understand the iphone 5s has about a 1400mah battery. this case was able to charge my phone through one full charge and then some, so it seems accurate. the discharge rate seems appropriate as well, similar to charging using a wall outlet. the case seems to automatically shut off power after the phone has been charged to 100. the lights on the back of the case are supposed to indicate percentage of juice remaining where each light represents 25 of the battery life, but the unit i received has a tendency to show 3 lights after delivering a full charge to the phone, and then very quickly runs out of the remaining juice after that. i think i8217m still getting the right amount of juice, but the indicators don8217t seem to be calibrated correctly.my final analysis i like this case a lot, but i prefer the unu dx case instead  i like that one because it has a bigger battery and is easier to interchange if i want to take the phone out of it. for me, the wireless feature isn8217t as practical as i thought it might be but that8217s just because of the type of user i am. functionally though, it is great and works as expected.",i received this product as a free sample in exchange for writing a review for it.

677,"i received this product as a sample from maxboost and so far have thoroughly been satisfied with this product. its quite small and light weight resulting it to be very easily portable and a quick device to just slip into your bag or pocket before leaving out the door. the led screen display is very easy to read and the battery percentage displayed is extremely accurate. this is what had me most impressed! other battery packs that i have receivedbought in the past either a didnt have a display screen for the percentage or b was so inaccurate it would display 43 left and then die. another plus is that the charging chord is removable so i can not only charge my iphone, but also my camera or anyone elses phone provided they have a charging cord with a usb end. i love the sleek design that the battery also has, very shiny and modern. only cons that i can think of is that though the looks are nice, fingerprints are left like crazy, but thats clearly only a personalcosmetic issue. also, though small, the battery is a little thick but i cant really argue because this is the smallest battery i have found with the incredible 5600mah it does have. lastly, though a great addition, the flashlight is a bit dim, not suitable for finding things in a large area, but great for illuminating something if you needed to read. overall, i think this is a great product and i definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a portable charger!",i received this product as a sample from maxboost
726,"i received this product as a sample to review and provide my opinion. first off, this battery pack is small for the amount of charge it is able to hold. the design is very slim and will fit very nicely in a pocket or in a purse. the battery pack has one usb output to allow single charging of a device. it has one micro usb as the input.the screen with the display is great because it allows you to know how much energy you still have and allows you to see it much more accurately than other battery packs.when i first got the product the battery was completely full and was able to fully charge my iphone 5s three times with no problems.overall very worth the money and i would recommend this battery pack to others.the only thing that i would change is the flashlight is not very bright, it is almost not even worth having it around. i think if they provided a brighter light that could be dimmed it would be a better feature.",received this product as a sample to review and provide my opinion.

215,"i received this product for free, in exchange for reviewing it.the good  this is a sleek little product, very thin, very light, by far the most easily portable battery ive ever used.  it quite easily charges my nexus 5 cell phone in a couple of hours, with juice left to spare.  traveling, heavy gaming, extended video watching, this device easily doubles the time that i can depend on my cell phone not running out of power.the intermediate  the company claim that this a rapidly charged device does not seem true to me.  it has 3 led lights, the lights initially blink then glow steadily as charge accumulates.  the device does appear to get a 23 charge within two hours, but it takes an easy 5 hours to get all three lights glowing steadily indicating full charge.  the device is extremely easy to use good and comes with zero instructions not so good.  even a mild techie can figure out how to do what needs to be done, but if you rank yourself zero on the tech scale, dont expect any help from the accompanying oddball pamphlet.the goofy  the company that markets this device claims to be based in the heart of america wyoming in their opinion, and covers their pamphlet and the device itself with vaguely patriotic nonsense.  in fact it is manufactured overseas.  the pamphlet that accompanies it has no instruction value, but does have some entertainment value as an example of some of the most poorly translated language that i have encountered in years.bottom line  incredibly inexpensive, really does charge my phone rapidly and fully, slick appearance, wonderfully portable.  its a real bargain.  just be prepared for a few chuckles at the pseudopatriotic logo and goofball pamphlet.","i received this product for free, in exchange for reviewing it."

429,"i received this product from unu as a free sample as part of their utry reviewer program. i currently own two of their other charging packs, as well as charging packs from other companies, but this is my first wireless charging pad product to review. i like how the case comes apart in the faceplate. its very easy to remove and replace when needed. the mat is awesome. ive never wanted to get a wireless charger mat before because it would just make the phone bulky and would only benefit when i wasnt using the phone, namely when it was charging. since this is also a built in battery pack, and slimmer than some other battery packs that dont have have the wireless charging function, its a no brainer as to why its worth it. its nice at night when in bed to not have to reconnect and disconnect the lighting cable everytime i pick up the phone. just set it on the mat and its good to go. while traveling, i love to have the extra juice to keep my phone going without having to plug it in. the only downsides ive noticed were getting used to the shape of the case was kind of awkward to hold at first, but once i got used to it it wasnt a big deal. also while charging, the phone and pack tend to heat up a little bit and wont cooldown until ive turned off the charging function. all in all id say its a step above a simple battery pack. the price is comparable to similar battery pack cases with similar mah settings and those dont even have the charging function. i just wish i had a charging plate at work also!",i received this product from unu as a free sample as part of their utry reviewer program.

413,"i received this unit free for testing and evaluation purposes.even prior to installing it on the phone i could feel the quality in unit. the unit includes a micro usb cable, battery case and wireless charging pad. per the instructions i charged the case first. the case provides two options for charging, you can connect the supplied cable directly to the battery case or charge it on the charging pad. i used the cable directly into the case so i could see the indicator lights that are in the rear of the case. once it was fully charged i installed it on my phone.it had a nice feel and didnt add much size to the phone. i had a lifeproof belt clip and it clipped right in so i was able to test it both as an in the pocket case and also on the hip.i generally have to charge my phone at least twice throughout the day and this allowed me to do it on the fly without having to find a wall outlet or computer. it seemed to charge in the same time using the wall outlet.overall the unit performed as expected. the only improvement i would make would be to have it use the apple lightening the cable or provide a longer usb micro cable as i found it was a bit short as compared to the standard apple cable.",i received this unit free for testing and evaluation purposes.
980,"i received this unit to test and review so made a short video unboxing it and giving my first impressions.let me say first of all that i did not like the aesthetics as much on this hub as i did on the m3h4. the plastic body is simple and plain, and the attached short cable will limit you to close proximity with the usb in. this would be the hub for traveling as it is pretty compact and you wont lose the cable seeing as how its attached.the one thing this hub has going for it is better write speeds. i tested this one along side the m3h4, and while the m3h4 struggled to write files in the low 100s mbs this hub consistently wrote for me in the 120s mbs. i was happy with the performance even if it did not have the looks i was going for.i rated this a four because it performed very well but just doesnt look as cool as some of the other aukey hubs. i know, shallow right?",i received this unit to test and review so made a short video unboxing it and giving my first impressions.
395,"i received this unu case for free as a sample as part of their tester program.ive owned 2 other iphone battery cases since ive been an iphone owner...1 for my iphone 4 and another for my iphone 5.  this one beats the other cases in every way.  however, it is a much more expensive case, and i guess you get what you pay for!what i love about it the battery case has a really nice rubber shell that is comfortable in the hand the case does not make the phone much thicker, longer, or heavier.the grace period to get used to the case in my pocket was one day. the extra battery is only in use when you want it to be, you choose when to turn it on and off. it easily gets me through a full day with plenty of spare juice for an emergency the wireless aspect is awesome.  is it necessary? no...but really convenient and easywhat i dont like about the case it causes me to use my phone a bit more because i know that i have the battery power for it i would have liked to receive 2 charging mats with the original packaging i am not able to charge my phone in the car while it is in my car mount unless i take it out of the caseoverall, i love this case and plan to use it until i get a new iphone.you will not be sorry!",i received this unu case for free as a sample as part of their tester program.
198,"i received this usb car charger for free from yubi power in exchange for my honest review.this little adapter allows you to turn the cigarette lighter port in your car into a power station for charging electronics. that means that you can charge all your power hungry devices on the go. you can charge devices like ipad, iphone, ipod and tablets to name just a few. its very simple and anyone could use it. simply take it out of the packaging, remove your cigarette lighter, insert this adapter and plug in a device via usb cord. there is a little blue light that tells you its powered up. its nice to have when you run out of power on the road and comes in especially handy on extended road trips. with this device you car is an endless power supply.there are hundreds if not thousands of these adapters being sold from many different sellers. i have a similar usb car charger that is much higher quality but it costs 23 times as much. the cost of this usb car charger is extremely low which makes it affordable to anyone. it works just as fine as my other more expensive charger it just looks different and is larger. this charger is a bit larger but i wouldnt say bulky at all. bottom line is if you are looking for a very low cost usb charger then this one is about as affordable as they come.",i received this usb car charger for free from yubi power in exchange for my honest review.

569,"i recently received an electron plus as a free sample for review and want to share my experience with it. i genuinely love this product. let me start off with the unboxing, the product comes with an 8 inch cable with interchangeable ends so that you can charge a multitude of devices, including the battery pack itself. there were 2 minor issues i had with this, and those are that i wish that the cable was slightly longer so i can charge the battery pack with a typical wall outlet, and my devices iphone 5s charger wasnt included, both of which are minor issues. it also comes with a velvet bag to carry the device and the cable in. the device is pretty hefty which is nice, because i can trust it not to break. i like the display, the flashlight is a cool but unnecessary addon. the battery pack itself takes awhile to charge which is fine, as it charged my phone from 098 in an hour with only 75 battery when i plugged my phone in, and still had 52 when i took it off. all in all, im a pretty big fan of this bad boy.",i recently received an electron plus as a free sample for review and want to share my experience with it.
528,"i recently received an electron plus as a free sample for review and want to share my experience with it. let me start off by stating that i have never used a product similar to this before and found it both extremely useful and of high quality.the electron plus is moderately small with a sleek look and glossy finish. it also comes with an almostvelvet type of casecover that makes it easy and attractive to travel with. my favorite parts about the electron plus, aside from its hightech design the screen lights up blue whenever you turn it on were 1 the fact that it has two usb ports that allow for multiple devices to be charged at once and 2 the extremely long battery life. i would fully charge my phone from nearly 0 to 100 and the electron plus would still have roughly 70 of its battery life remaining allows for roughly 3.5 full device charges. this product is extremely valuable in any travel scenario, where it has a much larger charging capacity than a typical chargingcase would.  also, it is extremely simple to use and recharge so even those who are not technologically savvy should have an easy time putting this product to use. i really do recommend an electron plus for anyone who wants to ensure their phone doesnt die during any period of extended travel.there were very few negatives i found with the electron plus. it takes a long time for the product to fully charge, but this isnt a problem as i got into the habit of just plugging it in overnight. also, the adaptor between the electron plus and my iphone 5s is the wrong size, but i was able to easily work around this by using my own usb chord. the additional flashlight feature on the side is a cool feature but pretty unnecessary the benefits from a flashlight and phone charger dont really complement one another.if youre on the fence about purchasing an electron plus, i say go for it  especially given the 40 price!!",i recently received an electron plus as a free sample for review and want to share my experience with it.

458,"i recently received my free testing sample from unu of their aero series iphone 5 battery case with wireless charging as a member of the utry program. placing my phone down on a charging plate was the one reason i thought this would be the best case id ever have.  needless to say, its not.  wireless charging gets 5 stars.  ability to keep phone safe gets 1 star.  dont get me wrong, wireless charging was awesome.  not having to carry any cables around was a big plus.  the biggest drawback is the fit of the case and its ability to hold the iphone 5 in place without popping off the front cover.  when i first got my case, the top cover wouldnt seat properly.  i tried every which was to get it to snap in place but i always had one area or another unsnap.  i left that issue alone and refocused on its usability as a battery case.  its ability to recharge my phone was right on par with the unu dx5 case.  quick charges and spare power left over for a quick charge again.  i liked the buttonsinterface much better than the dx5 but in my opinion the implementation of the case itself was poorly executed.  they should have stuck with how the dx5 encases the iphone instead.  the case on the aero feels flimsy and as i mentioned before doesnt hold well.  i dropped the case accidentally and the phone essentially flew right out of the case and landed on a hard floor.  whereas the dx5 forces you to slide the iphone into the case as a complete unit and only the top of the case slides on to complete the case.  id rather deal with having to lug around a cable and keeping my iphone safe then potentially damaging my iphone in this case.  hope unu explores this a bit and puts out a better product.update unu sent me a new case because of the fit issue and inability to snap the case completely shut.  5 stars for customer service!!!  new case still seems a bit flimsy and i still dont trust it to keep my phone safe.update 032614  unu came through yet again!!  they sent me an updated unit with a new top cover design that holds well.  there are no gaps unlike the previous version i received for my first evaluation.  i havent had the unit open inadvertently under normal use conditions.  very happy that unu has addressed this problem.  i updated the overall rating from 3 stars to 4 for the fix.  areas of improvement should include a cover for the 3.5mm opening so debris doesnt get trapped in there as easily and possibly using a dull finish on the camera aperture shiny black presently so that light doesnt reflect off the surface and onto the camera lens.  overall, i love it just as much as my dx5 case now with the added bonus of wireless charging!!!  nice job unu!! now, start working on adding additional expandable memory to the case like mophie and youll have a 5 star winner !!!",i recently received my free testing sample from unu of their aero series iphone 5 battery case with wireless charging as a member of the utry program.
313,i recently received my free testing sample from unu of their enerpak flexi portable usb battery pack that i intended to use for my ipad mini and my for iphone 5 as a member of the utry program. i8217d say its only drawback is its weight because overall it packs a lot of energy that can be used among various devices.  it8217s like the energizer bunny of portable packs!!  what8217s pretty awesome is its charging cable that8217s built right into the product.  unu evidently put a lot of thought into this cable because the unit includes a dummy micro usb slot for storing the cable and a separate working micro usb slot for charging.  the user interface is simple with just a simple press of a button to activate and to check it8217s battery capacity.  i8217ve used it to fully charge my ipad and still had enough left to top off my iphone.  i carry it everywhere without the cable it came with though because i had no need for the micro slot other than to charge the unit.  overall another great product from unu!!!  my only improvement would be an option for multiple usb ends so i wouldnt have to carry multiple cables.,i recently received my free testing sample from unu of their enerpak flexi portable usb battery pack that i intended to use for my ipad mini and my for iphone 5 as a member of the utry program.
361,i recently received this case as a free sample as i am member of the companys reviewing program. first off i would like to say that the case works great as a backup battery. the build quality of the case and charging pad are excellent. the case is a bit bulky but is easy to get used to and is expected of a battery case. i was able to continue to use a screen protector with this case. the only negative i have found is that the case seems to be very hard to remove from my phone. i found myself having to use lots of strength to pry the case off. i am hoping this will become less of an issue as i continue to break in the case. overall i would say this is a great product from an up and coming company. i would recommend this case to anyone looking for a battery case as it is affordable and even includes wireless charging.,i recently received this case as a free sample as i am member of the companys reviewing program.
442,"i recently received this case to review from unu.i found the case to arrive packaged very well. after opening, i was happy to find a very professional, sturdy case.the case itself that the phone cradles into is much thinner than most charging cases. this was very appreciated, as more bulk is never a good thing with a charging case.the biggest perk to this case for me was the charging pad.a thin, silver pad plugs into the micro charging cable that was included and allows you to simply place the phone in its charging case on top of the pad to charge the device. it charges quickly and provides seamless integration into the charging of the phone and case. the charger will charge the phone battery itself and then charge the charging case, which in my case provided about 1.5 full battery charges on a full charge.i move around a great deal while at work, so i placed the charging pad on my desk. i was able to leave my desk, immediately taking my phone with me and return to place the phone back on the charger within eyesight to monitor for notifications, etc.this was the biggest pro to the charger and case for my use. i generally would bring the phone in and forget to plug it in to charge, ending up with a nearly dead battery by the end of the business day. the simple place and go operation of the charging pad prevented this and had me leaving work with a full battery every single day.as for cons the white case is somewhat slippery in your hand. the finish is very smooth. i tend to opt for more matte finish cases that have a better grip, to prevent drops. the case is flush with the front glass screen. while some may like this, i prefer a slight lip past the screen as to somewhat prevent front glass breaks if dropped.the last con is that after using the case for about two months, the small button that covers the power button has broken off. i expect this will be under warranty repair, so i am not focusing on it as a critical negative. i have several friends with the cases and a few have had minor cracks, etc. the durability of the case could be improved slightly, i think.overall, a solid 4 of 5 star case. i would be very interested in getting a second charging pad for home use and will be keeping the phone case on my phone 247.",received this case to review 
346,"i recently took the plunge in my wallet and purchased an iphone 5. i know, the newest iphone is the 5s, but that thing is way too expensive for my blood. i like my phones like i like everything else in life  affordable.coincidentally, i was recently sent a free sample of a unu aero wireless charging iphone 55s battery case to review. this case is amazing! i thought it would be difficult or complicated to charge but it isnt. i was even able to use a regular multipurpose usb cable to charge it in my car. this is really convenient for people who are on the go and tend to go through the battery on their phone fairly quickly. the button to start charging your phone is on the back of the case. once you press it, it basically speed charges your phone. i loved that it didnt take forever and i was pleasantly surprised that it only took a few minutes to put it at a full charge. i think the only thing i would change is the durance of the phone case. for the most part its stayed in really good condition, but it did crack on the sides when i dropped it once.",i was recently sent a free sample of a unu aero wireless charging iphone 55s battery case to review.

343,"i recieved the unu aero wireless charging battery case and mat for iphone 5 and i have to say i am quite impressed.  this is an ingenious device.  it functions as a case as well as a spare battery.  the case makes your iphone truely wireless.  not only is the iphone battery and battery case able to charge wirelessly but you can also use the charging pad to sync wirelessly.if by chance you forget to bring the charging mat or rather use a cable you can do that as well.  by using a micro usb cable you can recharge the iphone as well as the battery case. the battery case will recharge first and after reaching 100 charge the iphone battery will recharge. if you wish to buy additional charging mats ie keep one at work and one at home they are available seperately which is a major plus.the battery case does not turn on automatically, ie no trickle charge, there is a button on the back of the case that you have to hold in order to turn on the battery pack to start recharging your iphone.  if you just press the botton on the back of the case it will show you how much charge is left on the battery pack.  the battery pack is 2000 mah the iphone 5 has a 1434 mah battery so the case can fully recharge your iphone atleast once and still have a little bit of charge left over.the case itself has a matte finish and a soft feel to it. the case doesnt add much bulk to the iphone and seems to offer adequate protection.  if you wish to remove the iphone from the case that is easy engough as well.one major thing that stands out about this case is that it is apple tested and approved.  meaning unu actually went through the hassle to get this device certified by apple ensuring no compatibility issues. this is not something you will typically see with aftermarket products.overall i am quite impressed.  as such i am rating this product 5 stars as it is the first case that i have seen that has these capabilities and on top of that it is apple certified.i was supplied a sample of the product for test and evaluation in order to provide a fair and honest review.",i was supplied a sample of the product for test and evaluation in order to provide a fair and honest review.

818,"i still remember when these outlets were used for lighters. i have friends with classic cars that still have lighters and ashtrays just dont try and use either! for whatever reason, the silly design of the lighter has transitioned into an automobile outlet, and have become essential to everyday traveling and commuting life. my car has four outlets  one in front, one between the front seats, and two in back. and i still seem to run out of available places to plug in devices and charge stuff. when im driving ill have the gps plugged in and mu cell charging.  ill usually have the ipod charging as well. all too often i need to topoff my tablet or charge a flashlight yes, newer models now charge from a usb port.so i really need chargers with multiple ports. one problem i have had with these in the past is heat  some chargers technically adapters ran so hot they were painful to touch  i could have used as a lighter.  the better quality ones have circuitry that controls the current. this model  the topg has dual ports and looks decidedly apple in white.the fat end has a rubberfeeling grippy texture, while the rest is glossy plastic. the metal contacts are exceptionally nice.  yea  sounds silly. but if youve seen some of the other models that simply used bent metal on the sides and a tin tip, youll appreciate this.  the thing does not fall out of the outlet.this version has two ports. one is 2.4 amps, the other 2 amps.  these work with any usb device, but some require higher amperage for fastest charging times. the markings for the amperage is my only complaint. its raised lettering, the same color as the panel around the ports. in my case, gray on gray. nearly impossible to read.  unless you have a device that needs 2.4 amps thats really not a concern. i colored mine in black marker, then wiped it off  this left reverse text i could read. does not look as nice though.so why two and not three or four? personal preference and clutter.  i have a two and three  two in the dash outlet and three also a topg between the seats.free product provided for honest review.",free product provided for honest review.
362,"i tend to use the wifi, bluetooth, music, gps and gaming features of my phone quite a bit, and all of these features are battery hogs. i find myself often having to plug my phone into a car charger as i commute home just to make sure i have enough charge to complete my day8217s end journey. on rare occasion, i8217ve moved the car charger to another car or otherwise misplaced the lighting cable and haven8217t been able to charge the phone, so i began researching high capacity battery extender style cases. i8217ve shied away from these cases in the past as the good ones tend to be expensive andor too bulky.enter the unu aero iphone case. i love the look and feel of this case! it8217s sleek, barely adds volume to your iphone, and looks, to me, like it could8217ve been designed by the folks at apple. i have the black case, which has a softtouch, rubberized, nonslip feel to it. the aero case consists of two parts  a rubberized bumper that you slip around your phone, and the battery itself, which you connect your phone to through the battery8217s lighting connector. you then snap the bumper edges around the battery and this configuration holds your phone very securely to the battery. the whole process of installing the case takes maybe 1015 seconds at most. once installed, the whole setup looks seamless, and the front of the case sits flush with the front glass of the phone so there is no obstruction to typing in landscape mode like you get with some other cases that have a lip surrounding the screen. the downside of not having a lip, however, is that you don8217t have lay flat protection for the front glass if you lay your phone face down. i don8217t tend to lay my phone down with the glass side down so it8217s not a problem for me. the case also comes with an headphone jack extender cable, which, given the svelte dimensions of the case,  provides a conduit through the bottom of the case to your headphone jack. i haven8217t found it necessary to use this included cable with my oem iphone headphones as tip at the end of headphone cable is long and slender and slides easily through the bottom of the case and into the headphone jack. the extender cable does, however, come in handy for plugging other devices into my headphone jack that don8217t fit through the bottom of the case.when i received the aero case i did not install it on my phone. instead, i fully charged it overnight as instructed in the user manual, even though it seemed to be fully charged out of the box. charging the phone and case is very 822021st century8221 using the included charging pad, which you plug into your existing iphone wall plug using the usb to microusb cable included with the case. the picture of the cable in the product image is not accurate as the picture depicts a wall plug directly connected to a cable with a microusb on the end. no biggie. you then charge the phone and the case by simply laying the phone down on the charging pad glass side up. no more trying to insert that darned lighting cable into the iphone in the dark! alternatively, you can charge the phone and case by just plugging the microusb end of the included cable into the battery itself. i8217ll probably use this method while traveling so as not to have to bring the aero charging pad with me.when you need to charge your iphone battery, you simply press and hold the little button on the back of the aero for about 2 seconds, which turns on the battery and commences the charging process. the charging process does not automatically turn on once your iphone battery is depleted. no biggie. you can talk, text, play games, surf the web, and do all of the things you can normally do with your phone while it is charging. while not using the iphone, it took the unu aero approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes to charge my iphone from less than 2 to 100. i8217ve noticed that the aero does seem to get warm during the charging process  not hot, but warm. once charged, the battery turns itself off. you can check and see how much charge you have left in the aero battery at any time by quickly pressing and not holding the button on the battery, which illuminates one or more of the 4 blue lights on the back of the case. once i use the battery to fully charge my phone, the extended battery must be completely depleted because when i press the button on the battery none of the lights are illuminated.please note that i was provided a free sample of this case for review and was asked to share my experience with the product. if you8217re in the market for a sleek battery extender style case, i can8217t recommend this case highly enough.",please note that i was provided a free sample of this case for review and was asked to share my experience with the product.

packs aimed at laptops that did include the large tip, for example intocircuit power castleintocircuit power castle series.the package also includes a 7 coiled charging cable, which can be stretched up to 18 inches. the charging cable for laptops is 28 inches. the package also include ac wall charger which has a cord that measures 51 inches.  ac adapter  has both ul and ec seals means it passed both us and european certification. it is rated for inputs 100240v which means it could be used when you travel abroad.it comes with a nice nylon carrying pouch, which fits the battery and tips.  however it does not fit the ac adapter. it would be nice if everything could be kept together in one carrying bag.the unit has a switch for 9v and 12v, this switch has no effect on charging tablets as

872,"i tested frieq super bubble neoprene case with two tablets we own 7 nexus galaxy tablet and 7.7 samsung galaxy tablet. i am attaching a collage of 4 photos that i will be referencing in this review the photos can be located by following customer photos link under the main photo.the sleeve case is well constructed the zippers operated very smoothly, all seams are finished well, there are no loose threads or blemishes. the case comes with a wrist band which can be optionally attached with a spring lock. it comes in several colors blue, grey, pink. the sleeves are identical except for the color.the sleeves size is 9 by 6.25. it is made out of neoprene. i typically think of neoprene sleeves as being soft and pliable, however this case is made out of two layers of neoprene with plastic insert between them, so it is fairly stiff with some flex it in. it provides more protection than a single layer of neoprene. the inside layer of neoprene has round bubbles which provide extra cushioning. the inside of the case is best seen in photo 4.the outside of the case has a 5.5 by 3.37 compartment with an opening which is a slit. the slit has no closure mechanism. this compartment is best to carry something that can be clipped to it like a pen or a stylus, or perhaps a cord that would stretch it and thus stay in.the dimensions of this sleeve are such that it fits both of our tablets the smaller 7 nexus tablet as well as the larger 7.7 samsung galaxy tablet. in fact, i was able to fit 7.7 samsung galaxy not only naked but also while it was in its leather case samsung galaxy tab 7.7 leather folio case. it fits quite nicely and snugly into the case either naked or with the case.photo 1 and photo 2 show the 7.7 galaxy tablet on top and inside of the sleeve so you can see the fit.photo 4 demonstrate the 7 nexus tablet fit. the fit works, but it is not snug. this is generally not a problem, unless you want the tablet to fit into your pocket. my husband likes carrying nexus 7 in his pockets jacket pocket or even pants pocket. and this case is a bit too large to fit in a pocket. he prefers the kroo neoprene case which is made out of one neoprene layer and fits snugly, but provides less protection.photo 3 shows how the sleeve can be used as a stand. there was no documentation to explain how the sleeve can be used as a stand, it took a bit of guessing to figure out that the tabs were meant to be spread out and used to hold up the device. it worked, but i have to say that i did not feel secure about leaving the tablet under flexed tension of the sides for a long time. i would not want to risk to have the tablet pop out of it, and i was not sure how the case will hold up if it was flexed for a long time.overall, i liked the case but i did not like the stand mechanism. double neoprene layer construction provides more protection than a typical one layer neoprene case at the cost of being slightly bigger and thicker.i was provided an evaluation copy of the frieq neoprene sleeve case for testing and review. i described both positives and negatives of my experience with the sleeve in this review. i hope you found my comments, measurements and photos helpful. if you have any questions i have not addressed i am always happy to answer comments.ali julia review",i was provided an evaluation copy of the frieq neoprene sleeve case for testing and review.

734,"i think this thing is pretty cool, particularly if youre one that likes the tactile feel of real buttons.its essentially a casekeyboard combo, as you need to put your iphone into the case in order for the magnetic bluetooth keyboard to attach to it. they keyboard itself is super slim and the case isnt overly bulky, but also feels solid enough that it would provide some protection in the case of a drop.as for the actual keyboard, its very slim but still has real buttons, ie you can feel when you push down on them. pairing it with your phone is as simply as turning it on and connecting to it, and charging it only requires taking it off and plugging it into the charging stand. its a little hard to read the keys initially since its silver on silver, but once you get used to where they are you can start texting typing very quickly using this keyboard.people that migrated from older phones or blackberries to the iphone might enjoy this keyboard since it brings back the tactile feeling when typing!i was provided a sample in order to provide my honest opinionthat being said, i think this casekeyboard combo is pretty cool.",provided a sample in order to provide my honest opiniont
417,"i totally love the convenience of my unu aero wireless charging battery case and mat for my iphone 5s!  it is so effortless when all you have to do is set your phone down on the mat and it instantly starts charging.  it only takes 45 hours for a full charge and it seems like i only have to set it on the charger 3 times during the week.  i love that i dont have to fumble with plugging in that tiny little lightning connector.  i was given a unu aero for review and i chose the black case.  the case has a great feel and wont slip off of surfaces.  it also protects my phone, as i already dropped it and i had no marks on the case or my phone!  the case is very compact and doesnt add a lot of weight to my phone.  in order to activate the battery you simply hold down the button on the back of the case and the phone starts to charge.  how simple is that?  this is a great product that would make a great gift for relatives or friends.  i highly recommend it as it is of high quality, and i love the service and support of the unu company.  future requests would be for other colors, such as red or blue, and a longer cord to the charging mat.",given a unu aero for review

790,"i travel a lot, and, until now, i had to carry a bulky universal adapter into which i then plug in a quad usb charger to get all my devices charging at once.  the beauty of this iflash international charger is that it comes with its adapters so that i can bypass one of the steps i often have to use.  the adapters one for europe and one for asia  it does not have the slanted prongs of the uk slide directly into the us prongs when they are folded into the body.  and if im staying in the us?  i leave the us prongs folded into the body for easy travel and leave the adapters at home.the usb charger has two 1a ports and two 2.1a ports.  the blue light that shows that power is flowing through the device can be annoying in the middle of the night, but i also find that it is essential, especially since some hotel rooms have dead outlets.  the only thing this charger is missing is a carrying pouch since i really dont want to misplace the pieces.as long as international travelers need no more than the two rounded plugs asia or the widespaced, rectangular ones for europe, this charger will likely be a welcome addition to their baggage.  i know that i really appreciate mine.  note  i received a sample for review. debbie lee wesselmann",received a sample for review.

475,"i want to first start off that i received this case through the you try program though unu. i was excited to try this case because i already own a unu dx battery case that i love. i have tried a couple other cases from different brands  they always annoyed me because they took so long to charge the phone. i dont know if unu uses some different type of hardware or something, but both the dx  this areo case charge the phone like it would if it were just plugged in with a regular charger. i find bullets are the fasted  easiest way to read a review, so here it goes...design the white has a glossy feel that i really like. it isnt slick unless youve got greasy hands. the back of the case is very thin for a 2000mah case. its not bulky at all  its no problem leaving it on. the lip that goes around front is very small, id like it to be a little more pronounced. the wake button is easiest if you push it on the left side. the charging pad is well made  the case sits on  charges with ease.function the case is a 2000mah case which will give your phone iphone 5 a full charge. the case seems to charge pretty fast on the pad. like other battery cases, the phone will charge first then the battery case.areas i would like improvement the micro usb cable they give you is about 2 feet long. you really cant use it. the led gauge on the back doesnt really tell the truth. mine said 2 of 4 left  i tried to charge my phone  it went from 20 to 26 then the battery case died.overall, i love the design of this case  the size, its not too big  it feels very well made in the hand. it provides a full charge which is what i need. the battery pad charging is a neat feature but id even buy this case as a stand alone battery case.pro tip  wait to turn the battery case on when it gets done to 20 or so  then let it charge to 80. it takes a lot more energy to charge from 80 to 100 because of the trickle charge. youll then be able to get more power out of your case once it goes back down after charging it up to 80!",i want to first start off that i received this case through the you try program though unu.
459,"i want to give the case a 5star rating. i really do. more so since unu was kind enough to provide me with a case to review.the case has a great feel to it. the softtouch plastic is grippy enough without being grabby or sticky.the added height and depth and weight are not enough to damage my user experience. in terms of size, most milspec cases add more bulk than this case. weight? the phone seems almost better for having a bit more heft to it.the audio port redirection cutouts do a fine job and, in a side by side comparison using my daughters iphone 5 housed in a body glove shock suit case, i found that the unu case was a tad louder.i was worried that the volume rocker as opposed to the two individual buttons to which i had grown accustomed would be hard to use, but it wasnt. the buttons were stiff at first, but limbered up after a few uses.the charging base works. it just works. lay the phone on it face up, not face down, the contacts have to make, yknow, contact and its charging. i did not put a stop watch on it, but it feel as though it charges about as fast as a cable, but now i can answer a call without snatching the cable out of the phone or the charger.the battery in the case itself is also a winner. 4 very small, discrete blue leds indicate charging status, and a button in the middle of the array will let you know the battery status with a short push or start to charge with a long push. from the first warning 20 i reached a comfortable charge level 87 while continuing to use the phone.so why not a 5 star review? whats not to like?i wish the lip around the screen were a bit deeper, or that unu would provide a serious screen protector with this piece of kit.and, as a small business owner i use card readers square and paypal here, and no card reader dongle will ever fit through that recess and finding adapters that will work is quite the pain neither square nor paypal support their readers with the use of adapters, but do not disallow their usage. the provided cable works, which is a relief. however, using a cable tethered card reader can be a clumsy, frustrating experience.final decision for a good looking and good feeling case that provides a good bit of protection and a lot of extra battery life, i would definitely recommend purchasing and using an unu aero wireless charging battery case and mat for iphone 5s  5, but i would also recommend a solid screen protector to round things out!updateive upgraded to case to 5 stars.after 60 days, the case is working as good as, if not better than, when it first arrived. i think, perhaps, i did not let the battery fully charge when i first switched it on. these days, it will take to phone up to 99 or even 100 from 20 while still enduring heavy usage.just to give you an idea of what i consider heavy usage... i stream netflix to my phone over wifi, concealed on a table, while working in a shop. as soon as someone enters, i shut it off. i use it to check email and facebook several times a day, and i play the occasional game. my day runs about 7 hours of solid, continuous usage! at 5 p.m., i have 70 left over for the evening. by the time i head to bed around 10 p.m., i have 20 left.the soft touch finish has held up fine. in my shop, my hands often get quite grimy and the case looks disgusting. a quick wipe, and the case looks fine.the power plate is quite handy. it sits on an end table next to my easy chair at home. i queue up a program on chromecast and place the phone on the plate and it charges while i watch. if the phone rings, ive no problem grabbing it... no tangled cords.the case is also quite durable. i have, unfortunately, dropped it from as high as waist height on more than one occasion onto a wood floor and have observed no damage to the case or the phone.after a couple months with this case, i cant see doing without! in fact, my spouse  who has held onto her iphone 4s because of its magnificent charging case  has agreed to upgrade because of this case!",provide me with a case to review.
718,"i was able to try this for free to sample and review from the company! i didnt really know what to expect as i have used maxboost items before, but never electronic ones. i was really pleased as soon as i picked it up. it feels really good quality and sturdy. even though it is quite small, there is some weight there. i suppose that is because of the battery, but still, it seems to be made so well.i know that they also make bigger versions of this, but being the nature that it is, i love this one because it is small and easy to just slip in your purse or pocket for on the go. it even comes with a short cord for your phone so you dont have to lug around that long cable that came with your phone. also, if youre using it at night in your vehicleetc., it has a digital, lit screen that makes it so easy to see any time, any where!last but not least, i love how well and quickly it charges! i have an android phone that it can charge in about 1 hour! i was hoping to get around 5 charges on my phone before having to recharge the battery pack, but ended up getting about 3. however, for such a small, portable device, i cant really complain!ill def. be getting more maxboost accessories in the future! i love that they have so many product choices and that they are such good quality!","i was able to try this for free to sample and review from the company! i didnt really know what to expect as i have used maxboost items before, but never electronic ones."
263,"i was asked to review this product by 5 star america. this one is easy! this remarkably slim 3100mah charger slips beautifully into a suit pocket, jeans, handbag, almost anywhere. most impressive is 34value34. value is cost vs quality. at 13.97 current this charger one of a few which can be charged while charging phone at same time is exquisite value. its smaller than my samsung note 2 phone, and appreciably thinner see my photos than my current powerbackup  anker charger 3200mah i bought here on amazon about a year ago 40 back then.the 5 star america slimline charger comes complete with a nice length of standard usb to micro usb cord, flat, so wont tangle as round cords seem to. if accompanying long cord is too bulky, there are nice alternatives in usb to micro converters  here on amazon to takeup less space. clean lines, good looking device. were i 5 star america, id make logo and text which sprawl one side 34scream34 less. perhaps it was design for the sample they sent to review and new production designs are less crowded.one thing which seemed better design, the large 345 star america around flag design logo, adjacent to 34made in china34 at bottom. poor fit. really not a big deal.there are three blue leds which glow and signal charging process.overall, holds charge a week, easily, until needed. id top it off every 710 days. with 5 star americas warranty, dont think you can possibly go wrong with this power insurance.ron",i was asked to review this product by 5 star america.
539,"i was excited to receive the maxboost electron as a free sample for review from the maxboost vipu program! shipping was very fast 3days and packed well in a recyclable bubble mailer.  the product box was not damaged at all, so if youre considering this as a gift, you can be assured of the condition of the merch will be mint.out the box it appears impressive in a glossy black finish, brushed and glossy chrome button scheme, built in flash light, and power level lcd display.  included is a concise user manual, black velvet carrying pouch, and attachments for every standard mobile device power connector miniusb, microusb, apple 40 pin, and maybe the apple lightning connector.  to explain, the box does not a say the apple lightning adapter is included, however, the manual does say its included. since my box did not come with one, ill be contacting the mfr for clarification but ill assume maxboost is keeping up to date with apple devices and should be including a lightning adapter as well.  ill update this review when i hear back.  but even without the adapter, any ordinary usb cord will work in its place.more about the device it has 2 usb charging ports, one designated 2.1a for fast on the go charging of tablet devices and one 1a for smart phones.  both can be utilized at once if necessary. the electron capacity is 10,000 mah, which means starting at full capacity, it theoretically should be able to charge aniphone 5 1450mah maybe 7x,or just an ipad 2 6900mah capacity 1.4x,or both the ipad 1x and the iphone 2x.but before i can experience this, ill have to wait for an overnight full charge of the electron, which may take a long while as it arrived charged at only 6, after 4hrs it filled about 30.the next day, approx 14hrs of charging to 100 i used the 1a port to charge a 7mo old iphone 5 starting at 15 and the electron at 100. it took the normal amount of time to charge the phone and at finish, the electron was at 86.  so if this is a typical contribution, then the electron will indeed charge my phone about 7x!it does take a while to charge, but if everyday i needed to charge my phone with the electron, id only need to recharge it once a week.  and i wont need to carry multiple cables, plugs, battery cases, etc...this the electron should take care of all that.i must say this is super impressive, as i honestly did not expect such good performance. for christmas i was given a single use lipstick charger and the performance on that is so so and i needed to remember to charge it after each use, and so i was drawing my expectations from that experience but what a surprise! the electron worked well!now i cant wait to see how it performs with an ipad using the 2nd port. ill post an update in a few days when the ipad needs a charge.as for the led flashlight, it appears to be a white light single diode. theres no indication of how many hours or days the light could function. the brightness is only ok, so do not expect this to be anything like a cree flashlight, because like i said, theres only a single diode.  you can only guess the lumens as its not stated but whatever it is, probably meant to function only as a bright keyhole illuminator. but not so important, as youd likely only consider this device to charge your mobile devices, and not as a torch.durability wise, id hate for it to suffer a fall.  that would really ruin the glossy finish.  and i expect this to eventually also come out in various colors to suit your personality.update 6214i was disappointed to learn there is no lightning adapter available unfortunately. not a deal breaker but wouldve been a nice inclusion.having the ability to charge 2 phones at once is definitely cool!  theres so much juice, you dont have to worry about having enough when sharing.  my friends gave it a try at our dinner meal after an evening 5k event, and loved it.the performance of charging an ipad 2 and an iphone 5 simultaneously is not what i expected, however, i believe if they were charged separately, i wouldve gotten better charges on each. id like to note that i was simultaneously using both devices so these results need more testing",i was excited to receive the maxboost electron as a free sample for review from the maxboost vipu program! shipping was very fast 3days and packed well in a recyclable bubble mailer.
452,"i was given a free sample of the aero wireless charging battery case to test and review by unu.  i am however, not required to give a positive review.  below you will find my review of the aero wireless charging battery case.first impressions8226 the package is white, easy to read and contains a window to view the product.8226 box contains a comprehensive list of all of the aero features and the enclosed instructions are also easy to follow.8226 the aero feels nice to hold and does not weigh much more than my regular case i had protecting my iphone.8226 the charging base is lightweight and well made.  the base footprint is much smaller than i expected.i8217m impressed8230.i also tested the unu power dx external case and the aero is nearly a halfounce lighter and the overall case is slimmer.  the aero also contains a higher capacity battery 3.7v2000mah.installation of the case to the iphone was easy and fits the iphone nicely.one of my favorite features is that the aero battery case cannot only be changed on the aero pad but can be directly changed using the micro usb port located on the bottom of the battery case.  when both the iphone and aero case are completely out of charge, i was able to recharge both in under 3 hours using the aero charging base.  with light to medium use, i can go 45 days without recharging either unit.during my test, the product has worked flawlessly, and i would recommend this to the entire amazon community.  this is another great product from unu....this is one of the best items i8217ve test and am planning to purchase a second base and another case for my wife8217s iphone.",i was given a free sample of the aero wireless charging battery case to test and review by unu.
588,"i was given a free sample of this product to test and review and post my experiences.i have had the device in my possession for 30 days.  i think this has given me ample time to use, evaluate anddiscern its strengths and weaknesses.initial impression upon receiving the device via usps, was a decent job of packaging in order to protect the device during shipping.  upon opening the packaging which was very easy and not one of those hermetically sealed plastic packaging cocoons that takes a skilled surgeon and the possibility of slicing off your fingers whilst opening i found the device, usb cord, and a small insert with instructions.the device was fully charged upon opening and was very simple to understand and use.the charging of my samsung 5 was pretty rapid.  it seemed to fully charge my device when depleted to around 15 in approximately an hour, while still leaving 20  30 of reserve charge on the device.after a fair amount of uses of charging my device and recharging the maxboost external battery, the life span of the charge on the external battery seemed to deplete slightly faster.i am often out in the field without access to an electric charger and have found myself depleted with no resource to recharge.  this setup worked well to have enough power to fully recharge the device, while stowed in my pocket or even while i was using the device.  it is a bit larger than others ive seen, but i attribute that to the size of the battery and its ability to fully charge my device and still leave some extra charge for another boost.another feature which in my version had was a handy led flashlight.  not a necessity, but i did find it useful.",i was given a free sample of this product to test and review and post my experiences.
74,"i was given a list of products to choose from in return for reviews. i chose this as well as theihangy ihgont84709 adjustable lanyard music necklace and earbudswith the hope that one or the other would keep my ipod secure while exercising.like its brethren, the music necklace, the strap is easily adjustable. the straps themselves are diffent. this one is rubber and feels more appropriate for me when exercising it doesnt soak up sweat the other is cloth  rope.the necklace locks to the device by the port used for charging. it felt secure and i trust it to hold my device barring someone running up and snatching it off of me.the built in stylus did not influence my review. however, if i did use one, i think it would be more functional to not have to disconnect the device in order to use the stylus.ultimately i found this ihangy necklace to best meet my needs in order to exercise and keep my ipod in place while listening to music or podcasts.",i was given a list of products to choose from in return for reviews.
749,"i was given this as a sample to review and ive noticed a lot of 5 star reviews when people provide reviews for free items, probably because they are worried they wont get more if they provide an honest review.i cant comply with that train of thought and have to point out the issues.first of the lighting in it is very dim compared to several others i have tested so its hard to tell if its on in daylight. that removed 1 star from the rating.second it is longer than others i have tested, which is only an issue at the car port that is behind one of my cup holders. for others, this may not be a concern so i didnt remove a star for this.finally it has no labels on it so you can recall what amps it outputs. this may not seem as a concern, but having acquired quite a few of these over the years, i need to remember what they can supply. otherwise they go in a parts bin i have for things i do not know if they are useful. as i have tested quite a few of these, i only keep the ones that are labelled with the amp output. this was my reason for removing another star.so overall ok, but not a 5 star product for me. be weary of all the 5 star reviews where the reviewer was supplied this to review. some items may be worth 5 stars but others may not be. read the reviews carefully and see if they point out things that may concern you.","i was given this as a sample to review and ive noticed a lot of 5 star reviews when people provide reviews for free items, probably because they are worried they wont get more if they provide an honest review."
517,"i was happy to receive this  complementary product for an honest appraisal.i own several of these external battery chargers from many different manufacturers, some with more power, adaptor plugs, cases, higher prices, etc. for the price, i think the  oxa 3000mah ultrathin external battery charger is an excellent value.this unit is ultra thin only 0.3 of an inch, 3.2 ounces, unassuming, and fits nicely in a pocket or small compartment of a purse or backpack. it comes with a cord and several adaptor plugs to address most of your charging needs. it has a built in flashlight that has come in handy several times. it feels well made, solid, metal, and very durable. led lights work as charge indicators to show battery level or charging status. automatic sleep function will work when battery is not charging it will power off to save power. it comes with a 1year warranty, but the manufacturer states they will extend that for six months longer.performance wise, it works extremely well, and charges very fast. it can charge my phone from 50 to 100 in about an hour. i can use it for a couple of days before needing to charge the unit itself. of course, needs are individual, and results will vary from person to person.everyone should have a backup my experience is that most phones batteries drain fairly quickly from camera, video, and social media use. my daughter now has no excuse for not keeping in better touch, since my phone died is no longer viable! the oxa 3000mah ultrathin external battery charger has a combination of low price, handy accessories, excellent performance, and small size. i recommend it.",i was happy to receive this  complementary product for an honest appraisal

925,"i was offered this speaker to try out and review, and i have to say im pleasantly surprised with this little thing.the sound when connected to my ipod touch 4th generation is surprisingly loud and clear. its sufficiently loud in fact, that i was able to listen to music a room away from where i had the speaker set up.the device itself is just a little larger than a golf ball with a suction cup and it has a nice looking, black matte, rubberized finish. i had no problem sticking the speaker to the back of my notebook computer, the face of my galaxy note 2 and a coffee table. the speaker comes with two very short cables one is for charging and listening simultaneously, and one is for listening only, that i would have liked twice as long as the one that was supplied. its not a huge deal, but a twelve inch cord really limits what you can do with the little thing.i did have some random noise with the speaker plugged in to my notebooks usb and 3.5 mm audio out jack, but ive had similar problems with some other speakers, so i might just be some interference that is specific to my notebook.overall, for the price at the time of my review, i think this speaker is a good bargain. i probably wouldnt have purchased it on my own because i wouldnt have believed the loudness  and quality of sound that this little thing puts out but having had a chance to try it, im really glad that i got a chance to review it.",i was offered this speaker to try out and review

250,"i was provided a free device in exchange for an honest review.this charger is similar in shape and size to a smart phone, and comes with a cable for charging.  what it didnt come with were instructions on how to use it.  since the cable had one end which fit into phones, and the other end fit into a standard usb port, it was fairly simple to figure out how to operate.charging the device itself takes a couple hours if you hook it directly to an outlet i happened to have an ipod power adapter, but quite a bit longer if you charged through your computer to attain the three solid green lights which i assume mean its fully charged.  then it takes another couple hours to charge your phone or kindle i was disappointed it would not charge an ipad.  but even though there were still a couple green lights, it would not charge anything a second time.i can see where it would be quite handy in power outages or other situations where there is no power available, but im not sure how long the device itself holds a charge, so not sure it would be of use when you needed it.",i was provided a free device in exchange for an honest review.

pad. overall, it seems to have a nice quality build.9830 installation  installing the case was pretty easy. you slide your iphone onto the lightning plug and carefully slide a frame over the phone to hold it in place. no problem at all and it had a nice fit.9830 use and performance  to activate the battery case, you press and hold a button on the back of the case and the battery turns on. my phone immediately indicated that it was charging and everything started working as expected. the battery did a great job of charging my phone with no problem and the case felt good in my hand. it was a little larger and heavier than i was used to with my typical incipio dual pro case, but not too much. the charging speed was great adding a little more than the average of 1 per minute of charge to my iphone 5.  overall, it worked very well.9830 key feature 1 charging   i have tested a few battery cases, and this one has some great features that were not available on the other cases i have tested.  first and foremost, it has a great wireless charging option with an included charging pad.  you just lay the phone on the charging pad with one of the charging studs on each side of the pad and it starts charging right up.  an important item to note about the charging.  the charging pad or charging via the micro usb cable charges up the iphone and the battery in the case separately with the iphone being charged first.  this is different than some cases that charge the battery case only and you have to charge the iphone with the case all the time.  charging the phone separately puts a lot less strain on the battery case and should make the battery case last a lot longer.  this is a great feature of the unu aero case.9830 key feature 2 sync   the other cases i have tried do not allow you to sync your iphone through the micro usb cable.  that means you either have to rely on wificloud sync, or you have to remove your phone from the case every time you want to sync it with a normal lightning cable.  what sets the unu aero case apart from its competition is that it supports syncthrough technology that allows you to sync your phone right through the micro usb cable with the case still on.  this was a great feature that really made this an awesome case.  one item of note, the unu aero must come with a higher quality micro usb cable, because a generic cable that i had didnt work for sync and gave me the unsupported device error.  when i plugged in the micro usb cable that came with this case, it started working perfectly.conclusionoverall, this is an amazing case.  it does a great job of charging your phone, and it has some unique features that really make it stand out from the crowd.  it is not a case that will protect your phone from major drops, but it offers some basic protection and performs great as a battery case.  if you are looking for a battery case for your iphone 5, this is the one to get because of the key features mentioned above.  highly recommended!","i was provided a unu aero series iphone 5 battery case for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what i found."
154,"i was provided a utechsmart 10000mah power bank for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what i found.look the product came in a clear professional looking box with product information on it. inside the box was the power bank encased in a form fitting clear plastic holder with clear plastic protective sheets over the top and bottom it to protect it. it also had a small instruction manual that was very well put together with easy to follow instructions, a usb cable with various connectors and a nice mesh carrying bag probably the nicest i have seen that came with a power bank.  the product looks sleek.  it is thin and flat.  it is slightly larger and thicker than my iphone 5 with an incipio case on it.  i like how it is thin because i can just lay my phone right on top of it instead of some other large capacity power banks that are more chunky.  it comes in a smooth black finish that is made of plastic and it looks and feels very solid in your hand. it has one power button, four blue lights in a wave design to show the remaining charge, a micro usb input for charging the power bank and a two normal usb outputs for charging your electronics one for apple and one for android.use and performance  it came with some charge to it so i plugged it into my computer and charged it until it was full. the four blue lights stopped blinking and stayed on indicating that the power bank was full. after it was full i did some testing.test 1 i took my partially depleted 2nd gen ipad that had 80 battery left and started charging it. the battery in my ipad is still extremely strong even though it is a little older. i checked it fairly often and got the following readings.starting point  80 chargeafter 10 minutes  82 chargeafter 30 minutes  86 chargeafter 60 minutes  92 chargethis was a short test and the power bank performed very well compared to other brand power banks that i have tested in the past.  once you get close to the 90 mark when charging a device, the percent increase per minute slows down significantly in all power banks that i have tested.  this power bank performed a little better the other brands i have tested when charging in the 90 capacity range.  overall, i am very pleased with the result and the speed was as good or slightly better than the other power banks i have tested.test 2 took the power bank without recharging it and plugged in my half way depleted iphone 5 that had only 49 charge remaining. i checked it every 10 minutes or so and got the following readings.starting point  49 chargeafter 20 minutes  71 chargeafter 40 minutes  89 chargeafter 60 minutes  97 chargeafter 71 minutes  full chargeoverall, great results. the average for the other power banks i have tested has been and an increase of about 1 per minute.  this power bank did slightly better before getting to the 90 capacity slowdown that all power banks experience.  it also seemed to top off the iphone a lot faster that some of the others.  during the test, i switched between the apple and android ports and saw little or no difference between them when charging an iphone. the power bank easily charged a my iphone 5 without any problem and the indicator lights showed that it still had plenty of juice for at least another couple of charges.conclusion overall, the utechsmart 10000mah power bank worked great during my initial tests and usage. the performance was as good or slightly better than some competing products that i have tested.  the product has a great, thin design that makes it easy to use or transport, especially for charging a phone where you can just lay the phone right on top of it.  it looks and feels very solid. i can see that the large capacity of this power bank would be an excellent option for longer travel use such as a long plane trip or other travel where you do not have access to a power plug.  highly recommended!","i was provided a utechsmart 10000mah power bank for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what i found."
199,"i was provided a yubi power ypmwcc1a 1.0a rapid usb car charger for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what i found.what you should know before you buy9830 this thing is tiny.  it only sticks out of your cars charging outlet about one inch.9830 it is a basic phone charger with a single 1.0 amp usb charging port.9830 it charges just as fast as any other charger about 1 charge increase per minute on an iphone 5.9830 very compact for travel if you need to take a car charger with you on trips renting a car at your destination for example.detailed review9830 look  the product came in a professional looking plastic hanger display package with the car charger displayed in the front and product information on both sides of the inside card.  it also had some basic instructions on the back of the card not that you really need them.  immediately you see that this is a very small and compact car charger. it has a single 1.0a usb port and a blue led power indicator light on the front. it is black and grey in color and blends nicely in my vehicles interior.  it also appears to have a very nice build quality.9830 installation  as with any car charger, you basically just plug the unit into you cars charging outlet. once plugged in, it fit well and had a tight connection that would not easily fall out of the outlet. i have been using an amazonbasics dual port 2.1a usb car charger for a while now and i immediately noticed that the yubi power charger makes the amazonbasics charger look giant. comparably, the yubi power is tiny and is much less noticeable in my car. my pathfinders charging outlets are on the side of the passenger area where a knee can easily bump the charger. the much smaller yubi power gives the passenger a little more leg room in my vehicle, as opposed to the amazonbasics charger that is much easier to bump.9830 use and performance  once installed, i did some basic tests to see how the yubi power car charger handles charging up my iphone 5.  during my work commute, i took my iphone 5 that had 65 charge remaining and i plugged it in.  the charger increased the charge on my phone by 25 in about 27 minutes or around 1 per minute, which is a great result, especially once you get around the 8590 charge range where you typically experience slowdowns in charging speeds.  it worked perfectly and as well as any other higher priced chargers that i have used.conclusionoverall, this is a great little 1.0a usb car charger with a solid build. it is really small and takes up almost no room in your car.  the unit looks good and performs very well. if you are looking for a basic, single port rapid car charger for your phone at a low price 7 at the time of this review, the yubi power ypmwcc1a 1.0a rapid usb car charger is a great option. highly recommended!",i was provided a yubi power ypmwcc1a 1.0a rapid usb car charger for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review
190,"i was provided an etronic quad port usb 2.1a travel wall charger for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what i found.what you should know before you buy9830 the charger is pretty small for a four port charger.9830 has four ports ports that share a total of 2.1a output.9830 it had fast charging speeds when charging two devices, but will slow down as you add more devices due to the low total output.9830 removable prongs for travel.9830 good tradeoff between speed and compactness for a four port charger.detailed review9830 look  i received a sample product that did not come in a retail package, so i cannot comment on the packaging or if it normally includes an instruction manual. i only received the wall charger. it is a clean white wall charger with a blue company logo on the side and four usb ports pointing downwards or upwards if you plug it in upside down. the four usb ports share the 2.1a total charging capacity. it also has an led power indicator light around the ports.  the prongs detach with the press of a button and gives you two separate pieces for travel.  it looks nice and appears to have a nice build quality.9830 use and performance  i plugged it into a wall outlet and did some basic testing to see how the etronic wall charger handles various charging situations.test 1 single charging  i first tried charging my iphone 5 by itself.  it had a charge of 20 at the start and after 30 minutes, the charge increased to 54.  better than 1 per minute, which is a very fast charging rate.  the charger performed well when charging a single phone.test 2 simultaneous charging  later that day, i took my iphone 5 that had 32 charge and my ipad 2 that had 34 charge and charged them simultaneously.  after 10 minutes, the iphone charge increased to 43 and the ipad increased to 37.  again, very good results when charging two devices at the same time.  this is basically the best you are going to get because adding additional devices will continue to eat into the 2.1a total charging capacity.conclusionoverall, this is a nice 2.1a quad port usb wall charger. it is pretty small and compact for such a large number of ports.  it also has a nice quality build.  the total 2.1a output will not give you the fastest charging when charging four devices, but it does very well when charging one or two, and the additional ports can be used as needed.  competing four port chargers have a much bigger form factor, so you are trading charging speed for compactness.  if you are looking for a quad port usb charger with good speeds in a small form factor, the etronic is worth a look.",i was provided an etronic quad port usb 2.1a travel wall charger for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review
502,"i was provided with a free copy of this item for testing and my fair and honest evaluation. i have gone through 3 different pairs of bluetooth headphones this year alone, the fit was either awkward or bulky or just plain uncomfortable. i like to listen to music or watch netflix on my tablet while im cooking so its important that i dont have a dangling cord i could accidentally julienne into whatever im cooking. if the headphones done work or fit properly, its a huge inconvenience and downright annoying. i was very skeptical when i unboxed the headphones but i was pleasantly surprised. the fit of the headphone is the best ive come across so far, in this affordable price range. the sound is perfect , no distortion. i have been using them several times a day for the past week with no problems. i received the headphones on saturday and gave the other headphones away to a few of my friends on tuesday, i wont be needing those anymore.",i was provided with a free copy of this item for testing and my fair and honest evaluation.

670,"i was sent this item to try for free and i have only positive things to say.  it is small and lightweight so very easy to carry in a tiny purse or a pocket.  the led light is just the right amount of light that it doesnt hurt your eyes to look at it.  it fits more than 1 of my devices so i dont have to invest in a different model for each device.  the cord plugs in and releases easily from each device.  the flashlight is awesome for finding a keyhole on the car or your house when it is dark out.  if it had any downsides it would be how quickly it picks up fingerprints however they are easily wiped off with a soft cloth so no reason for alarm.  it charges quickly and i believe would be excellent in times of emergency so i am very lucky to have been chosen to try this.  if you have any of the devices it is compatible with such as samsung galaxy s5 prime iphone 5s 5c 5 4s 4 6 ipad air 5 4 retina 3 2 1,ipad mini retina 1 2 google nexus 5 4 7 8 fhd 2samsung galaxy note 4 3,samsung galaxy s4 s3, s4 active, mini all new htc one m8,mini 2,m7, m4lg g flex, lg g pro 2, lg optimus g3,g2,g2 mini, g pad 7.0 8.0 8.3 10.1 samsung galaxy tab s 4 3 7.0 8.0 10.1nokia lumia you would be very pleased with how reliable this product is.  will be recommending to the family and friends who i know have some of the above products.",i was sent this item to try for free and i have only positive things to say.

723,"i was sent this product to test for free from maxboost. while i was sent this item to try the thoughts expressed in this review are my own. i was not paid for this review  will speak my true feelings on this product.have been using the maxboost electron mini 5600mah usb portable power batter for almost two weeks now. upon opening the box it was a small portable battery. the size is perfect for a backpack, purse or even a pocket. honestly i thought due to its small size it would not be powerful, but i was wrong. while the electron mini is small it is powerful enough to fully recharge your tablet at least once. i have a samsung galaxy 4 smart phone, and it fully charged my dead phone, and my brothers i phone that was at 5 power. both phones were charged to 100 of course after charging those two phones the batter was out of power.the only downside to the maxboost electron mini is that it take while to recharge it fully. think it took about 2 hours or more to fully recharge. honestly this was the only negative, and honestly its not such a big deal. positives about this product is the small size, and its small enough to fit into the palm of your hand. like the display window that clearly shows you how much power you have left, and there is no guessing.the intelligent display lets you know the current output  input. display window is big enough to see. with the maxboost electron mini its so simple to use. in the box you shall find shiny black battery with a micro usb cable.maxboost electron mini 5600mah can charge your mp3s, gaming devices, tablets, smartphones, and cameras.  this charger can work on almost any device on the market.  its amazing that a device that weights as  light as 4.3oz can be so powerful. i just love the ease of use. often many portable power devices become hot to the touch, but i did not experience this with my maxboost electron mini. now if they made it in green would go crazy. hey i like to have cute colorful items.like to keep this with when i am away from home  keep it in my day bag. will use this for traveling. would highly recommend this item if you need a powerful portable battery  its a value priced item. thank you maxboost.",i was sent this product to test for free from maxboost.

1020,"i8217m a big fan of the brainwavz s1 actually all of their headphones 8211 have yet to be disappointed with any of their products. the s1 has been my main set for active use e.g., workouts, runs, etc. since the flat cable is very durable and resistant to tangles. the s5 keeps all the good features of the s1 and adds to it 8211 the sound quality is richer and better defined.that8217s not to say the s1 sounds poor 8211 they are quite good, in fact. but the s5 are better. the highs are better defined and the midrange has more punch to it. the bass comes through clearly without moving into the harsh territory when the volume is pushed as the s1s can do. the overall sound quality is very pleasing.the build quality seems solid 8211 as solid as the s1 or better. i love the flat cable! i know that8217s something that is not appreciated by everyone, but for me it8217s been working out wonderfully. although this as most other brainwavz headsets comes with an excellent hard shell case, i usually tote my earbuds wrapped around my mp3 player in my pocket. easy to carry very stressful on the cables and can lead to tangles with round wires. flat wires, especially those with a thick jacket such as these, survive that abuse with zero problems.the earbuds themselves are more sleekly shaped than the 8220can8221 style of the s1.comfort is in line with the customary brainwavz style, which is to say it8217s outstanding. it comes with a wide range of tips to fit pretty much any ear, plus the comply foam tips which are my favorite. if fitted properly you end up with zero ear irritation plus excellent sound isolation and bass response.these are an overtheear design much like the s1. i never used that design prior to the s1 and it did take me a little time to get accustomed to it. it became second nature quickly, and the design is a lot more stable when exercising than the conventional inear design.these are more expensive than the s1, but you can hear the difference in price. still, if you8217re looking to keep the cost down a bit, the s1 is an excellent performer as well.great sound, great comfort, wonderful cable design, and it comes with a solidly made case and lots of eartips. highly recommend.sample provided for review",sample provided for review
791,"i8217ve been using this iflash quadport dual usb port high output walltravelac charger for a while now and i8217m quite satisfied with the performance. not a year mind you, but long enough to know i like it.  i8217ve worked with several ac chargers since they came out with the singleport and have tried them all. i do have a few favorites and one of the dualport ones was an iflash.  at the time it was a brand name i8217d never heard of, but from experience i know it8217s decent quality and something i can depend on.i feel like a broken record here because this charger is the same as another quadport iflash puts out.  the only difference, and a major one at that, is that this one comes with two adapter plugs.  one will work in this adapter will work in southern europe, the middle east, africa, asia, and the caribbean.  the other will work in the uk.  i8217m not sure of all the locations these work, but the iflash pretty much covers europe with this package.usually i8217ll charge many of my devices such as battery packs through my pc, but when i need a rapid charge i8217ve set aside my iflash for when i need it ... which tends to be frequent.  it8217s a very solid charger and even has a wavelike design on the body.  the flipdown prongs are also very handy, especially if you want to travel with it.  some of the earlier ones didn8217t have this feature and i had to keep them in the original box.  i still save the packaging no box with this one because when i8217m not using a charger i don8217t want dust to get in the ports.i prefer charging my devices via ac chargers, but often plug into my pc.  with four ports, i can maximize the use of a receptacle rather than the slower pc alternative.  i often forget and leave things plugged in, but if i use the iflash i won8217t forget.  the ports are clearly labeled on the front and the iflash is especially nice if you have a couple of tablets to charge in addition to a couple of smaller devices.features9658  supports all ipod, iphone, ipad, samsung galaxy, motolola droid, htc smart phones, amazon kindle models... and many more9658  highest power rating at 20w  4 amps output at 5v. fast charging of your devices.9658  intelligent overheat, overcharging and overcurrent protection builtin.9658  super portable quadport usb charger yet almost the same size as some single port ones size of 2.99 x 2.24 x 1.14 inches and weight of 3.7 ounces.9658  all rights reserved. all trade names are registered trademarks of respective manufacturers listed. apple, iphone , ipad, ipod  are registered trademarks of apple, inc.specs9658  input  ac 100  240v, 50  60hz, 0.5a max9658  outputtotal  dc 5v 4a maxport 1  dc 5v 1.3a maxport 2  dc 5v 1.0a maxport 3  dc 5v 2.1a maxport 4  dc 5v 2.1a max9658  weight  3.7 ounces9658  size  2.998221 x 2.248221 x 1.1482219658  material  pc material9658  led indication  blue9658  certifications  fcc, cee, rohswarranty9788  12 months limitedsample provided for review.",sample provided for review
557,"i8217ve mentioned before, when i tested the maxboost 10000mah pulse, that one thing i dislike is a company that makes claims that overreach the capability of their product.  as a rule i haven8217t been enamored with battery packs that feature a digital display.  everyone always seemed to love them except for me and the reason being was that they seemed to drop way too much charge when initializing.  the manufacturers claimed that, more or less, it was standard procedure.  frankly, i never bought into that theory.i still don8217t buy into that theory because i think that it8217s a faulty one simply made up to justify a poor performance.  the maxboost electron only dropped 5 of it8217s charge and boosted my ipad8217s by 14 in thirty minutes.  initially it seems a tad slow, but then steadily moved along.  i usually use a first generation ipad to test all my battery packs to provide consistency.my informal testing says a lot and what is says is that the maxboost electron is a dependable battery pack that is a performer.  it will do what you want when you want it to.  there are a lot of decent battery packs out on the market now and manufacturers are stepping up to the plate to provide top notch ones. maxboost has definitely joined the club with the electron.startthe ipad 12the maxboost electron 10015 minutes 15    electron 9830 minutes  26    electron 9560 minutes  32    electron 9490 minutes  45  electron 91120 minutes  50  electron 90150 minutes  60  electron 88180 minutes  69  electron 76210 minutes  79  electron 73240 minutes  87  electron 71255 minutes  96  electron 70270 minutes  100  electron 68the maxboost electron kept on going at a steady rate as i recorded its progress.  i was quite pleased as i watched it8217s steady push as it totally charged my ipad.  my 10000mah maxboost did a great job, but the 15000mah did as well, but left me assured that if i really needed the battery pack, the power would be in my hands.  i8217m particularly thinking of the airport scenario where there are plug hogs.  sometimes it8217s pretty tough to find an available receptacle to use for charging.initially i misread the specs on the back of the maxboost electron and thought i was dealing with a 12000mah battery pack.  i was quite amazed that the incremental power drops were so small.  with 68 of the electon8217s charge left i could charge that ipad all over again.  no doubt that this battery pack has power and is a real performer.features9658  the world first power pack with digital display window that is capable to exhibit power level within 1 and monitor the input and output charging state.9658  monster size 15,000mah battery that can charge almost any portable electronic devices up to 7 times including, iphone 54,4s3gs, samsung galaxy series, ipad, ipad mini, and almost all tablets, camera, and mp3s.9658  multiport charging capability allows for multiple products to be charged at the same time using a 2.1a and or 1.0a port. the electron plus can efficiently charge tablets, smartphones and most other devices.9658  certified reliable a samsung batteries are deployed to ensure 500 recharges as well as better safety, longevity and efficiency than most other batteries.9658  the electron plus features an ultra portable and stylish design in either piano black or elite white. it even boast a super bright emergency flashlight that helps you through any power outage scenario.specswhat8217s in the box9658 maxboost electron plus portable battery9658 usb charging cable9658 microusb, miniusb, apple 30pin, apple lighting adapter tips9658 user manual9658 travel pouchspecs9658  add 400500 to smartphones, 400500 to large screen phones, 1000150 to tablets9658  input 5v  2a max9658  output 5v1a  5v2.1a9658  dimensions 4.95 x 2.8 x 0.8 inches weight 9.8 ounce9658  recharge time 1012h via 1a usb wall charger no ac charger is included, but product works with any usb wall charger. note that significantly longer recharging time is expected if adapter output less than 1acertificationsce fcc rohscompatibilityappleiphone 5s5c5, 4s43gs3g, ipad air mini 1 2 retina, ipad 1234 original apple cable required but not includedhtcone m7m4 mini x and moresamsung galaxy s5s4s4 minis3s3 mininote 3note 2 and moremotorolamoto x  droid maxx razr, bionic  atrix 2 4glggooglenexus 45710 optimus g1g2nokialumia 920 900 n8  n9othersblackberry torch curve 9900 9360  sony ericsson xperia arc s, x10  ps vita  mp3 mp4 gopronote pulse will not work with asus tabletssample provided for review",sample provided for review
806,"i8217ve tried lots of little bluetooth speakers. most in the price range of this one are pretty similar in terms of sound quality. they sound pretty good. they have the same kinds of features wireless bluetooth connectability, volume control and the ability to interrupt the music and take a call. they get loud enough to fill a room, and pack all that sound in a surprisingly small package. what makes the difference is the style and shape, and sometimes the style and shape effects the overall sound quality.i really like the form factor of this one. it8217s a tessellated cube, covered with squares, and on two sides of the cube there are little holes in the squares that help transmit the music in two directions for a kind of stereo effect.it seems to be pretty durable. it8217s not very heavy, and the enclosure is made from plastic, but it seems to be a solid build.it8217s pretty simple to use. plug it in via the enclosed usb cable and charge it up. the battery lasts for about 5 to 6 hours of listening, and doesn8217t drain noticeably between uses.there8217s a power button, and a button that puts it into bluetooth pairing mode. it8217s appeared on my phone as 8220magic cube8221 and connected easily. there8217s no lag in the sound, which is something i8217ve seen on a few other bluetooth devices. that means i can use it as the speaker if i8217m watching a video on my phone. mostly, though, i use it for music in my office.there isn8217t a 8220next track8221 and 8220previous track8221 button. the only controls you have on the cube are for volume and also you can pause the music and take a call if you have it paired to your phone. it has a built in microphone, so that you can take a call with this without picking up your phone.you can also plug in nonbluetooth devices via a 3.5mm cable that comes with it.how is the music? not 8220audiophile quality,8221 but not bad. the bass isn8217t great, and the high and low notes are a bit 8220muddled.8221 it doesnt sound tinny or hollow, but the sound is not expansive, and while it seems to be designed for multidirectional sound it is much stronger and better sounding in the front side the opposite side from where the usb plugs reside than in the back side. so, really, it is most effective if you put it in the corner of the room with that side facing outwards. still it sounds much better than the speakers on my phone, and it gets much louder. you could use this to accompany a small party, and it would be great for a picnic. sample provided for the purpose of testing and review.",sample provided for the purpose of testing and review.

974,"if you are looking for an inexpensive way to add wired network capability to your laptop, netbook or tablet that has a supported os and a usb port, then the sabrent usb nic is a good way to go.it works well. simply take it out of the package, plug it in. wait a short time for the drivers to load. plug the network cable into the usb nic and you should be ready to go.one thing to be aware of  the amazon listing and images have osx support listed. the problem is, the system requirements on the package clearly state that they only offer windows support xp, vista, win 7 and win 8 and ive verified it works fine with 8.1 and 8.1 update. i do not have easy access to an osx machine, so i cant verify if the packages is correct or if the amazon listing is. if i can get hands on an osx machine, i will update my review.in terms of performance, this is 34only34 a 10100 nic. you do not get gigabit support with this. performance at 100 mbit is comparable to the 100 mbit performance from my windows 7 work laptop connected to a 100 mbit port. if you have a ton of usb devices plugged in, you might notice a performance issue, but with just web browsing, music streaming, etc, this is fine. large file copy performance seems about the same as well, but i did not do robust testing to compare.the nic is light weight and travel sized. i will carry it with me when i travel and i have my surface pro with me. sometimes wireless just isnt available, and in those instances this will be a life saver.the speed is adequate for travel. the weight is great for travel. if you need to add 10100 wired network capability to a windows based device, this is an inexpensive way to do it and it works well.highly recommended.i received a review sample free from the manufacturer.",i received a review sample free from the manufacturer.
463,"if you are looking for extra battery life for your iphone, and you want contact charging instead of having to plug in, this is a great battery and case design.the design is quite exquisite. it does add weight to the phone, since you cant really get more battery power and not add weight, but its evenly distributed over the surface of the case. the case itself seems to melt around your phone. one down side you might have is that now you cant see the apple logo or the color of your phone. yes, its something silly, but if you buy a phone with color to it, dont you want to show the color off instead of covering it in black? for me, this is inconsequential as a useful phone with a charged battery is more important than the 34form.34 function over form for me.the battery itself is 2000 mah which means you get just a touch more than a full charge added to your iphone. this should be enough to get just about anyone through an entire day, whereas without i was finding that i would get about 69 hours of use before needing a charge, and right around 10 hours before the phone died. having this case on the phone is a life saver for sure.the contact base is well designed, and to charge the phone you just drop it on the base and it starts to charge. ultimate in lazy convenience, since now i dont even need to bother trying to plug the phone in at all.to charge your phone, you must press a button the case to begin feeding power to the iphone. this is fine with me, and i believe this is as designed so that the battery case isnt providing a constant trickle charge which can shorten the life span of the batteries.one down side is that while charging the phone, the battery can become pretty warm. during the winter this is good, since it means you have a hand warmer.i really like this case. definitely worth the money.highly recommended.i received a free sample product for review purposes.",i received a free sample product for review purposes.

208,"if you buy this charger, the first thing that will probably strike you is its color mine is a rather strident orange  including its cord  and they come in a variety of other tints like green and blue and pink, etc..but the second and more important thing will most likely be its size while it has the approximate width and length of a deck of cards, its depth is only about the thickness of a suit of cards. still, i found it had the ability to charge a kindle or phone or other products with ease. and i loved the sleek style of it, minus the back side of the review copy i was given more on this in my final paragraph.there have been a few comments about the irony behind 5 star americas battery charger being made in china, but i think the most interesting fact is that they are offering a 9999day warranty. whats that, something like 30 years? i suppose they didnt want to commit to a lifetime warranty, so all they could muster up was a day short of ten thousand... if im still here, it will be my pacemaker that its aiding.according to 5 star america they accomplish this in part due to a higher conversion apparatus within it that allows the battery to stay cooler while accomplishing a betterthanaverage transference of battery power from it to the device its charging. five star america declares on this page that its batteries can go through over 500 full chargedischarge cycles over the life of the product.its remarkably easy to use...while there are almost no markings on the device other than product info on the back, and it has no onoff switch, it doesnt really require much to figure it out. there are only ports one for input and the other for output. up to three indicator lights appear near the output port to indicate its remaining charging potential  which were yellow in the case of my orange device  and it blinks as well when it is in use. the supplied threefoot long cord is flat, which i liked since it made rolling it up so natural and compact when not in use about the size of four stacked quarters.i think the 3100mah battery extender is a remarkable device that is not only inexpensive 13.99 on amazon for all but the green device, delivered...if you have prime, but powerful too its 2.1a output accomplished a full recharge of my android smartphone in under two hours, and still had more potential charge left. as i said earlier, it successfully recharged my kindle which, to be honest, was not anywhere near fully discharged. i do not have an ipad, and i have heard conflicting reports as to the 3100s success there  but i think it wisest to say that it is highly unlikely that this small device could make any more headway there than a small extension towards hours of use. but i dont think its designed to, either.all in all, i think the five star america 3100mah battery extender is a great small product for recharging cellphones and smaller devices, which is really all any sensible person would use it for. its made to be shoved into a pocket or a purse including its threefoot cord which rolls up into a size not much bigger than about four or five quarters and should serve its owner well as a backup when emergency battery extension or recharges are warranted.about the only negative thing about it besides the americachina disparity some reviewers harp upon is that the writing on its back side sort of ruins the aesthetic cleanliness of the product and its minimalist nuance. i have read that this is only true of the review copies, but ill soon see while i was given a charger for reviewing purposes in exchange for an unbiased review which this is, i have just purchased two more for my daughters christmas stockings."," i have read that this is only true of the review copies, but ill soon see while i was given a charger for reviewing purposes in exchange for an unbiased review "

572,"in midjanuary 2014 i wrote a review of this batterys predecessor  maxboosts smaller 10000mah external battery.  and i made the comment 34if you are not going to see a wall or car outlet for a 34scary34 long while, this is a great charger to have tucked away.34  then that winter storm hit more than half of the u.s. and i watchedlike most of us didthe atlanta, ga highway system turn into a parking lot!  34scary long time34 took on new meaningat least for me it did!  i sat watching the tv screen and imagining some heroic person walking down the highway handing out fully charged maxboost chargers...  after seeing those poor people stuck on that georgia highway, ill never underestimate the potential for natureor whatever unknownto keep me away from a power source!my point is, whether you know in advance you are not going to see an outlet for a long while or you are just considering an external battery charger for 34piece of mind34, you might as well get the largest capacity battery, and the most userfriendly battery charger, that you can. this one has the superior charging power you need!i know there are a multitude of chargers available there are chargers available that are only the size of a business card and fit in your wallet that will allow you to make a call or two in a dire emergency, and there is this 34plus34.  of course, there are hundreds of external chargers out there for every type of situation in between these two.only you can decide where your own comfort level is.  you can tempt fate and just plan for a minor inconvenience or you can buy this one and rest easy. but if you think you will need to recharge your phone and your tablet more than once before you see a charging source, or if you only have a phone and you will want to recharge it up to ten times before finding a normal charging sourceyou should consider this charger.this is not a charger for the pocket of your jeans or your evening bag. in a laptop briefcase, in a backpack, in a largersize purse or in carryon luggage, the size of this will be inconsequential. it is 10.75 ounces, the 10000mah is 8.35 ounces.  also, at 2 7834 x 4 7834, it is an inch longer than the 10000mah.  both sizes have a velour, drawstring pouch to help keep the charger scratchfree and all the adapters and cable together.  the bag is a bit small for the bigger charger.except for its bigger charging capacity, this charger is much like its smaller predecessor  both have outstanding charging capabilities.  besides that major and most important facti have never seen a better user manual it is very wellwritten and explains everything and provides accurate pictures. it assumes that you have never used an external charger before. i am very impressed with the simple, little manual. i wish all manuals worked so well.it has a digital readout that clues you in to exactly what it is charging at the moment and how much charge power is left. there is no ambiguity, no guesswork at all.it has a flashlight! i always carry a small flashlight with me. having the charger and the light in one piece prevents clutter and helps me rationalize the halfpound heft.i received a sample product from maxboost.",i received a sample product from maxboost.

800,"in my opinion, there are three things to take into consideration when evaluating this speaker  functionality, design and sound quality.this speaker rates very high on functionality.  the controls are on the top of the cube and they are very easy to use.  you do need to hold the power button down for a couple of seconds for it to power up. you cannot just press and release.  you will hear a sound when the speaker powers up.  the paring is simple, press the paring button and listen for the sound to indicate it is paired up with the connecting device.  once it is paired up, it will remain paired with that device until you pair it up with a different device.on the rear of the speaker are the usb connection for charging the battery and an input connection for a nonbluetooth sound source.the speaker has a range of about 30 feet,  we used the speaker out on the patio with the source inside the house.  it worked just fine through the walls.the speaker design is aesthetically pleasing.  of course i recognize that is a matter of opiniontaste but for me the bamboo color cube looks really neat.  the speaker is in the front and also you get some sound from the rear.  it has a fairly small footprint and will fit in with just about any decorator scheme.when it comes to sound, how you judge the speaker will depend on what you are listening to and what you are used to.  keep in mind that this is a relatively inexpensive speaker. the midrange and high end sounds are pretty good.  when it comes to the bass end of the scale, it is not the tops.  good but not great.  but again, you must take into consideration all the features build into this speaker.  if you are looking for very high output across the full range of sounds, you will need to invest in much more expensive equipment.this speaker really does provide some good range of sound.  the bluetooth features are excellent and the design is really nice.  all in all, it is a very good product for the price.i was provided a sample product for testingreviewing purposes.","provide some good range of sound.  the bluetooth features are excellent and the design is really nice.  all in all, it is a very good product for the price.i was provided a sample product for testingreviewi"
446,"in short, i love this thing. i chose the model in white through the unu utry program. this case is solid and sleek  shiny, white, not too bulky like other battery cases might be. little blue lights on the back let you know when its charging, and how charged it is. and it feels sturdy  not plastic and iffy. its a really solid piece of professional product.shipping was swift, and i was able to plug in and use it right away. both the pad and the case have a micro usb charging port, so if youre in the car, you can still charge the case just as easily. and it charges both the case and the phone all at once. i love this thing.as of right now, theres only a few minor cons1. the aux cable port. you need to use an extension accessory, which doesnt always connect the best in general, for any of them. sometimes it takes a jimmy or two to get sound on both sides of my car. my current aux cable itself is a bit on the skinny side, and that doesnt fit, so i feel like a ittiest bit bigger could make a big and convenient difference in connection to sound and the like.2. the case wont come off. again, this isnt a bad thing whatsoever  its good. but getting your phone fixed at the apple store .. really confused everybody there! the genuis bar had to go out back and get a special tool and everything to pry this guy off. took at least ten minutes for them to get it off. thankfully they didnt break it ... but buff said.3. my little charging pad died.  i know thats an easy fix, and i could probably order a new one, but i hadnt even had it a week yet. considering its new, im sure theres still one or two minor tweaks it could sort out.4. so this might have something to do with my current lack of a pad ive had to charge using the micro usb port since my pad doesnt work anymore. so after charging a while, my phone ends up at 100 through being charged by the micro usb port which is awesome, kudos. however if it starts to dwindle, and i turn on the case, i get maybe 20 battery and the case shuts off completely. maybe because im using the port and not the pad it cant really be charging completely, but its hard for me to tell. i keep the phone and the case plugged in overnight, and it still does the same thing. so again, hard for me to say.overall, i do really like it. they just need to fix one or two minor things as anything new on the market would. hopefully theyll come out with more colors soon, too!",i chose the model in white through the unu utry program.

741,"item was provided by manufacturer for review. the review represents my unbiased opinion.this device takes me back to the glory days of a real keyboard that slides out from a phone. i prefer a physical keyboard. for one, it makes it easy to text and not look at the keyboardscreen for whatever reason you may have, such as walking down the street while you pay attention to traffic. as we have evolved to an era of on screen keyboards, it does take some getting used to using a tactile keyboard again, as well as the key placement. this was designed for iphones, which don8217t have the 8220vibrate8221 that an android has upon button depression. so this device fills it in easily. once you adapt to key placement on the keyboard, you do speed up your typing speed.connecting for the first time the device is very simple to connect the first time. i just had to turn on bluetooth on my iphone and the iphone found the device and i paired it in a few seconds. beware that this keyboard is only meant for iphones, so do not attempt to pair with an android as it will not work i tried just because i was curious.design the keyboard is very thin. you8217d barely notice it thicker than any standard phone case. it is a standard qwerty keyboard for alphabetic characters. symbols are secondary characters on the keyboard. in essence, imagine an extra metal layer on top of a phone cover that has the keys. like a slider phone, the keyboard 8220slides8221 out for horizontal or vertical use. the magnetic case attaches at just the right point for that. the case leaves the buttons and charging port and headphone port free to use and doesn8217t interfere with the phone8217s functions.the keyboard is bluetooth and portable, so it does have to charge. the case comes with a 8220dock8221 that you can put the case into to charge. the charger uses a standard micro usb charger. you can attach the charging base and take it with you if you want, or leave it next to your bed to recharge. it only recharges the keyboard.bluetooth pairing is easy. the magnet is very strong, so there8217s little risk in losing your keyboard. it8217s easy to charge as docking to the charging base that8217s included. it uses a standard micro usb charging for the bluetooth keyboard. the other side of the magnetic attachment is a case for your phone. the keyboard case double as a phone case, so it protects your phone. the keyboard can be oriented on the long edge or the short edge of your phone. it really acts like a slide keyboard.it8217s hard to combine a thin design and a sturdy keyboard, but oxa has done it with this device. they8217ve managed to create a working keyboard that is strong and functional and have thought of being able to attach it in either long or short configuration and storage. i have no qualms about losing the keyboard from everyday use since the magnet is so strong.extras the package came with a stylus and cleaning cloth. the stylus is well designed. the edge where the rubber tip meets the body is actually smooth. it won8217t scratch your screen. i thought this was a nice addition for my phone.highlights very thin keyboard, and a built in case. strong magnet to hold the keyboard in place so you don8217t lose it. wireless, so you can also use it as a wireless keyboard completely away from the phone.",provided by manufacturer for review. the review represents my unbiased opinion.

508,"ive always wanted simple wireless earbuds like these with only a short connecting the two sides, so i was happy when sharkk sent these to me for my fair and honest evaluation. other wireless earbuds ive used have been too bulky or had extra parts that made it difficult to use while working out, but these are perfect for the gym. i couldnt find the instruction manual, so i was confused for a while on how to charge and pair the device, but eventually figured it out. i later discovered the manual secretly stashed away in the rear, bottom compartment of the packaging.sharkk has included two different kinds of tips for the earbuds, both with three different sizes. one of the tips has a shark finshaped extension that fits into the grooves of the ear so it doesnt fall out as easily. the other is a more conventional circular type that every other earbud uses. i prefer the conventional type, as its easier to put on and didnt fall out during workouts anyway. with 6 different tips, youll probably find the one that is very comfortable for you.because of the minimal design, theres no room for a usb charging port. instead there are a pair of small charging contacts on the right earbud, which a special usb cord can clip onto to provide power. this means an extra usb charging cable that i have to keep around, but i think its worth it because it enables the simplistic design. charging takes about two hours and stereo playtime is about 45 hours.the sound quality is okay, but not as good as most other earbuds ive used, mainly because the bass is weak. the bluetooth range is a little bit better than my other bt headphones, and the audio stays synced up even if i go out of range for a little while. one issue i have is that whenever i pair up with the computer, it defaults to the mono headset profile. i have to manually disconnect from it and reconnect to the stereo profile. also, i occasionally have to switch offon the bluetooth on my computer to get the earbuds to work. this might just be an issue with my computers bluetooth configuration.to summarize, the product is easy to use during physical activity, designed very well, and is a good value at 30. however, the bass is pretty weak and you might experience some bluetooth profile issues.","ive always wanted simple wireless earbuds like these with only a short connecting the two sides, so i was happy when sharkk sent these to me for my fair and honest evaluation."
23,"ive been buying goddess garden products for four years now  it all started with a travel packet from a whole foods and theyve become my favorite sunscreen. i like the idea of spray sunscreens and find that many fall flat, so when i was offered to be sent a product for review from goddess garden, i asked if it could be one of the sprays. this trigger spray is, in my opinion, nicer than the presstospray option goddess garden provides  the coverage seems more full, im more comfortable with the texture, and it seems more moisturizing without being greasy. im very pale and come from a family with a high incidence of skin cancer, so im a daily sunscreen user. i found that the trigger spray sped up application in the morning compared with a traditional lotion application. however, dont think that this spray will get you out of using your hands for application  the spray is dense more like a squirt and you will need to use your hands to even out the product.there is a light scent to all of the goddess garden products  i find them all to roughly smell the same. theres the standard zinc oxide sunscreen scent, which i dont find to be offensive or any stronger than any other that ive tried, and an herbal scent which is a little sharper but doesnt bother me or the two asthmatics in my household. i generally prefer unscented products and this is about as close as you can get with a sunscreen.ive been using this spray daily for about a week and dont find it to be significantly different with regard to timetoburn than the traditional lotion that goddess garden offers. i do find it to be more soothing to my dry skin and less thick to apply.i will purchase this product in the future for my continued use  i think its probably the best 34natural34 sunscreen spray option ive encountered.disclosure of material connection i will receive a lowvalue free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review. i was not required or compelled to write a positive review. the opinions i have expressed are my own. i am disclosing this in accordance with ftc 16 cfr, part 255.",disclosure of material connection i will receive a lowvalue free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

639,"ive been testing the maxboost electron plus 15000mah dualport 3a premium usb portable external battery pack for the last couple of week after receiving a review unit from the manufacturer. in my way of thinking, you can never have too many external battery packs. as a friend is fond of quoting 34abc  always be charging34. while there are a few things that i could put down as 34disadvantages34 to the maxboost, it keeps coming back to one thing for me... this battery has some serious power reserves. i could go out into the desert for a week with my iphone and this battery, and i wouldnt care if i never found an outlet until i returned.at 15000mah, this is the largest battery pack i own. its got a bit of heft to it, such that you wouldnt forget you had it in your pocket or purse. but if you had it in a gopack or backpack when youre going through your day, itd be fine. it comes with two output ports at 1.0a and 2.1a. technically, you could charge two phones or a phone and a tablet at the same time. the input to the unit for recharging comes from a normal micro usb cord. the storage bag black velvet comes with the usb cord and adapter plugs for micro usb, mini usb, and the 30pin apple connector. if you needed a lightning connector for an apple device, youd have to bring your own. finally, theres a builtin flashlight that turns on when you click the power button twice. you may never need it, but its there.in terms of recharging speed... when charging my iphone 4, i was getting more than 1 of recharge per minute, which is my general measuring standard. when done charging, i found that i had only gone through 9  10 of the battery reserve. i could easily get seven or eight iphone recharges on this battery! charging my ipad was more of a strain on the unit, and it was taking about an hour for each 10 of charge. if my ipad was completely drained, id look at the battery to give me one recharge. id probably do better to plug in the battery while i use the ipad, and let it slow down the rate of ipad battery drain so i get more usage time instead of waiting half a day to get a fully repowered ipad.on the battery charging times... it took most of the day to take the battery unit back up to 100 capacity. it didnt seem to matter whether i had it plugged into a usb port or into a power plug adapter. its definitely not fast, and it seems to slow down the closer you get to 100. i would plan on recharging it overnight when you dont think youll be needing it. slow? yes... but the amount of power it gives me when it is completely charged makes that an ok tradeoff for me.you could get real picky and say that the black glossy cover on the unit attracts fingerprints way too easily. i say thats what shirts are for... to wipe off fingerprints. i cant get overly excited or bothered over smudges when compared to what the battery can actually do which is lots!if i wasnt so enamoured over the amount of backup power and number of recharges i get with the maxboost, i might consider making this a fourstar rating. but power trumps all, and this is a five in my book. great job, maxboost...disclosureobtained from manufacturerpayment free",disclosureobtained from manufacturerpayment free

22,"ive been using goddess garden products for a couple of years now.  i was looking for a natural, mineralbased sunscreen, andive been very pleased with their 34sunny body34 product line.  the trigger bottle makes this sunscreen easy to apply and it doesnt leave as much of a white residue as a lot of other natural sunscreens doits labeled 34eco sheer34 and i think this is an accurate description of the results.  its very lightweight and its definitely waterresistant.  i can apply it before a brief swim and know that when i get out of the water, i wont need to reapply it again right away.the only cons i find that the trigger spray can get a bit 34drippy.34  when i first applied it, i was surprised at how thin the sunscreen itself was i had been using other goddess garden sunscreens before i tried the trigger spray.  i wasnt sure it would be effective, but ive been to the beach several times this year now, and i can safely say that it is.goddess garden products cost a bit more, obviously, but personally, i have found that they are worth it.  i typically use less since i only have to apply sunscreen once a day, as opposed to several times, and ive experienced better results than i experienced with other nonorganic sunscreens.  personally, im willing to pay a bit more for a product that doesnt contain a potentially toxic synthetic sunscreen.  in addition, in recent years, ive discovered im prone to melasma synthetic sunscreens simply arent effective in preventing melasma, so i needed a sunscreen with zinc oxide andor titanium dioxide.  goddess gardens 34sunny body34 has both.disclosure of material connection i will receive a lowvalue free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review. i was not required or compelled to write a positive review. the opinions i have expressed are my own. i am disclosing this in accordance with ftc 16 cfr, part 255.",disclosure of material connection i will receive a lowvalue free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

205,"ive been using this charger for a few months now, having received one for review in november 13, and i like it more now than when i first got it, which is often not the case.superficial things that initially put me off the gigantic logo on the back which other reviewers have noted the fact that it looks like a cell phone, for no good functional reason that i can think of, but isnt it could have the same form factor without the glossy black side that looks like a phones screen the 34manual34 has absolutely no information at all about the use or functioning of the device, just promotional text.those were all irritants, but once i began using the charger, they faded into inconsequentiality.first, i love that the device comes with its own usb cable a short one, since sometimes i dont want to carry one of my regular long cables with me. second, the included cable is flat, which means that its very easy to 34spool34 up and it doesnt tangle in your pocket, bag, briefcase, or wherever you keep it. third, because it is about the same dimensions as a typical smart phone, it slips easily into a pocket in my purse or my computer bag  you could even carry it easily in a jacket or jeans pocket. fourth, and perhaps most important, when it is fully charged, it can charge my samsung phone from 20 to 100 and still have a lot of charge left for other devices. ive even charged my kindle ereader using it. it is slower than charging the kindle from the wall, but it works.as well as being convenient for travel  even for everyday outings and running errands  it is handy to have in the event of a power outage. i also have a larger external battery charger, but although it works well, it isnt nearly as convenient, since it is much heavier and about 6 times larger. i have a smaller, more flimsy external charger that charged once, giving my phone only an extra 10 before it ran out of juice, and which thereafter did not recharge.it does take a full 7 or 8 hours to charge this battery charger after its been depleted, but given how much charge it holds and how many hours devices such as a phone or portable bluetooth speakers can run off of this battery once it is charged, i dont see this as a drawback. i simply charge it overnight. if you need to have one ready at all times, you could get two of them and alternate which one is being charged.i have to say that while i found the huge logo and the glassy 34looks like a smartphone but isnt34 appearance somewhat offputting, this battery charger functions extremely well. if i were shopping for one of these, its looks would have put me off since i was given a sample and tested it over months, i found its size, capacity, and functionality more than made up for the offputting logo and the manualthatwasntamanual after all, what kind of directions do you need in order to plug one end of the usb cable into the charger and the other end into the charging device or recharger?, but the case and manual do need a redesign.id recommend this charger to anyone who needs a handy, pocketsized but sturdy, high capacity charger and doesnt want to spend an arm and a leg on one.",having received one for review
251,"ive been using this external battery charger for a few weeks and i like it. the battery itself is 4.5 x 2.5 inches. its slightly bigger than an iphone 4s. it is extremely lightweight and when i took it out of the box, i didnt actually think this was the battery i was supposed to get! its sleek and actually looks like a phone or ipod. i was slightly disappointed with the look of the back because its full of 345 star america34 advertising and support. i wouldnt mind the logo but having the whole thing covered takes away from the simplicity of the design. this may be just the review sample but if not, a customer may be mislead as its not the same as the picture. writing on the back of the device also indicates that the battery is made in china. thats just confusing because the name of the company is 5 star america and their logo appears to be 34designed for america.34 although i didnt look at the product before receiving my sample, i assumed because of the name the product was made here in the usa. i would pay more for a device made here and feel the name is somewhat misleading.the charging cable is roughly 3 feet 3 inches. its the same color as the battery which makes it very easy to keep track of. its also flat and seems like it will hold up well. when i charged this external battery, i left it plugged in all night so i cant comment on how long it actually took to fully charge less than 8 hours. i used this at the airport to charge my samsung galaxy s4 active and, while using it the whole time, it charged it about 60 in 2 hours. not too bad considering i was using it while it was charging. my boyfriend used it to charge his ipod touch 5th gen and it fully charged it in about 45 minutes.all in all, this is a good external battery. its lightweight, easy to store, and is very portable. it was very nice to have while traveling. i received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.", i received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.
243,"ive been using this external battery charger for two 2 months.i must say that it is a good external charger for emergency cases. i,ve been using it mainly with my iphone 4s.it has the capability to charge my iphone from almost dead battery to 4550 in 60 minutes. and this has helped me a lot now because the iphone battery is coming up to its end, it just last a few hours 24 hours after a complete charge.the device can charge my iphone 4s up to 80 before it drains out completely 90100 minutes.this external battery charger is charged in about 68 hours when it has drained out.it is useless with my ipad.prosizeweight is the size of an iphone 4, and much less thinner and lighter. easy to carry both of them at the same time.capacity 3100 mah it is enough for me, but i am not a heavy cell phone user, so beware of this issue if you need much more power.price i think 13 is a good price for this emergency device. helps when you are in trouble.charging lights are helpful to know charge state.product is made in china. there is no statement that it is made in america. it has a logo that says designed for america, that i think is just rhetoric.conthe iphoneipad wont charge when the device is getting charge, so you must charge your device directly to the ac power output.the back of the device would be much nicer if all the logos and words were not in there, but i really dont care.user manual not a manual, just blurb.web site useless. ... is not available at this time...? so, dont expectoverall rating 3,8 stars ... for its price.disclaimer i got this charger free from the manufacturer. this has not altered my opinion about the device.ok i hope this review is useful 4 u, please dont forget to leave your v..., thanks!.",disclaimer i got this charger free from the manufacturer.

707,"ive owned a number of battery packs, both from this company and others, so i was expecting yet another battery when my review sample arrived. i was surprised by the size, which is smaller than the earlier generations of batteries. this one also had a nice display that not only showed the percent of charge, but also if it was being charged or charging another device. to me that is a big plus over batteries that have no display or use four small leds to indicate the approximate percent of charge remaining. this one is exact to one percent.what impressed me is the capacity. last year a battery rated at 5600mah was like a brick compared to this one. before i go on, let me explain rated capacity. there are a number of factors that make it misleading in much the same manner that us epa ratings for mpg are pieinthesky. factors such as heat, wear on the battery from repeated charging and even loss from poor quality cables and connectors reduce the rating. out of the box i multiply the rated capacity by .9, and in the case of this one you can realistically expect about 5040mah. as time goes on the wear on this battery will reduce the figure to about 3920, but that is probably twelve to eighteen months of hard use.assuming that this is realistically rated at 5040mah here is what you can expect from a few common devices  for an iphone 5s with an internal battery rated at 1560mah you can expect to more than triple your use time. for my samsung tab 3 10.1, which comes with a stock 6800mah battery i can still get well over an additional seventy percent more use time. you can do the math on your own device and see how well this will or will not fit your needs.another feature that impressed me is the charging port will detect the rate your device can be charged and adjust the output accordingly. the range is between 1.0 and 2.1 amps.a convenience is the builtin flashlight. its actually handy because of the compact size of this battery. but that it icing on the cake. the unit itself does a great job quickly charging my devices, and with the integrated circuitry to detect charging rates and guard against over charging i feel safe with it charging my note 3 and tablet, both of which were on the expensive side.",review sample
876,"ive reviewed many cases of all sorts, but some of the ones i have the most use for are cases in which i can actually transport my electronic equipment in.  the design allows the user not only a safe mode of transport, but also a functional one.  the versatility of the case will enable the user to swap off devices.  if you decide to take your ipad mini, kindle fire, or even a nook along with you you can.  i actually put an old nook in this case and  it fit perfectly.  the charger and cord can be nestled nicely in the front pocket.  many cases, i find, seem to be tablet specific, but this frieq design is the exception.  there are several devices one can carry in this sleeve.the composition of the case intrigued me.  neoprene is actually an excellent material that will afford quite a bit of protection in the event of a drop.  the interior of the case has a bubbled texture and look.  i have three different cases, the blue, gray, and hot pink.  the zipper, the logo, and the inside matches the specific color.  the bubbles will definitely act as a cushion in the event of a drop think protective bubble wrap.  of course there are always those freak accidents, but this would be my case of choice were i going to travel with a tablet in a carry on.  for example, when i travel i put an assortment of electronic devices in a carry on from a small laptop to a tablet.  the extra cushioning will actually prevent a tablet from damage hitting against my small laptop.i always like to test anything i will be carrying media material in for water resistance. i placed it under the faucet, gave it a quick once over and was quite surprised to see that quite a bit of the water beaded off.  it did however, absorb some, but i wouldnt be worried because of the thickness of the case.  the outside fabric appears to be made of some sort of soft nylon material.  it has duel zippers, a feature that is especially nice if you want to put a small notebook inside.  there is an attractive frieq logo on the front that matches the inside color.  you can purchase a subtle gray or go wild and take the hot pink, one of my favorites.horizontal landscape viewing is not particularly practical as the weight of any device i used tended to make the case unbalanced and fall forward.  the initial smell of neoprene is strong, but it quickly dissipates i have another case made of neoprene. these are very minor considerations for me and all in all, this is an excellent quality case.  i will most likely be using this one when i head to the library to do a bit of research or take a tablet with me when i travel to read or play games.  if you need a durable, attractive case that will afford topnotch protection for your tablet, this might be just what you are looking for.  the only thing that would make this one perfect would be the addition of a lanyard.frieq super bubble neoprene sleeve case coversfrieq super bubble neoprene sleeve case cover  grayfrieq super bubble neoprene sleeve case cover  hot pinkfrieq super bubble neoprene sleeve case cover  bluesample provided by the distributor for review.",sample provided by the distributor for review.

286,"ive some experience with portable charging devices and the unu enerpak flexi portable meets and exceeds my expectations for what a device of this type should be.  the first thing i noticed upon the arrival of my package was the size of the unit itself.  it is extremely portable and easy to carry, not likely something you would want in a pants pocket, but it would easily tuck away into a jacket, a purse, backpack, briefcase, or messenger type bag.  anything really that a student or business person would likely have on hand anyway to carry their electronics or personal items should have room in spades to stash this charger.  weighing in at only 4.5oz, its no problem to carry for extended periods.unlike the charging platforms i have used previously, this device does not require direct connection to a wall socket to charge itself, rather it can be connected to a microusb charger that you probably already have stockpiles of from previous devices over the years.  for practical purposes, this is a huge benefit for me as it allows me to charge the battery pack using a standard microusb charger. even while i am in the car if i forget to charge it before heading out!built into the device itself is a small usbmicrousb cable which is removable, these are the small winged tabs that you see in the product pictures.  if you wish to charge something that connects via microusb simply unhook the microusb end and plug into your device.  hit the power button and charging will begin.  other devices ie apple 30 pin or lightning can use their own proprietary cables by removing the usb end from the unu charger and inserting the proprietary cable into the charger.  connect the business end to your device, hit the power button on the charger and away it goes, receiving power at 1a.the size of the battery 4400mah is enough for approximately two chargers on a current iphone 55s which is fantastic in my opinion for a product of this size.  of course, if you are using an iphone with this product you would need to carry your own device cable for charging.  the one exception to this rule that i have found is if your iphone is paired with unus dx external protective battery case, no additional apple cable is required.  the reason being that the dx case connects to the phone via lightning connector, but has a microusb port which is used to charge and sync when the phone is in the case.  this is my current set up and so far it is working flawlessly.in summary, my experience with this device is that it is a reliable and very portable means of recharging small portable devices smart phones when charging from a hard line is impractical or inconvenient.  the small size, built in microusb cable which makes charging a breeze, and the ease of charging up the battery pack via any microusb charger means that youre less likely to spend time scrounging for cables to make this device go to work for you.  having something that is both practical as well as 34grab n go34 makes this a winner in my opinion.please note, i received a free sample to evaluate and review from unu.","please note, i received a free sample to evaluate and review from unu."
698,"ive tested a lot of powerbanks over the years. the thing that makes them stand out is finish does it look well made ease of use and extra features. this one has it all. it is nicely finished with smooth edges and a solid feel. it is very easy to use with one usb and one micro usb port. it comes with its own cable as well. there are two nice features on it. one is the onboard led flashlight. the other is the clear, blue display that shows the amount of power left in the powerbank. this is not a bar reading of one to four bars but an actual percentage reading. this will charge my phone about 45 times before needing to be recharged itself. tablets and larger devices will use it up much faster though.so this meets and exceeds my expectations for a unit this size and this price range.i was provided a sample for testing and review.",i was provided a sample for testing and review.

322,"ive used multiple battery packs before, such as anker monsters with 12000 mah, but i found this one to have strategic benefits over others. the flexi portable usb battery pack is small, and therefore very portable  in the week ive used it, the device has always been in my laptop bag, concealed from anything else. this portability is awesome as i can reach for it easily and get charging. the size definitely contributes a plus for the battery pack!charging wise, this 4400mah gives some serious power to mobile users. as an iphone owner, i know from experience that the battery doesnt last as long as youd expect in average situations. this is a perfect remedy to that  it gives just enough power to get through the day without having much to worry about. rather than carrying around a bulky external battery or bulking up my iphone 5s with a battery case, this unu gets the job done, fast and effectively.build quality is where this device could use improvement. from the exterior, the unu looks almost playful  it doesnt scream professional or wow as id like it to. the lights are an area that are favorable  the leds are clear indications of the percentage remaining. nevertheless, i am sure that unu in their next version of this product will address the build quality, and hopefully make it classier looking, in a way.overall, this device is perfect for the commuter  it keeps your device charged for day to day work. its portability adds to the convenience and overall functionality of the battery pack. solid 45  id recommend to any consumer.disclaimer i received this product from unu free of charge for my honest and sound review. no intention for a positive review was implied.",disclaimer i received this product from unu free of charge for my honest and sound review.
1021,"ive used thebrainwavz s1 in ear headphones, and they had outstanding audio quality. i didnt know if anything could top the s1 earphones, but brainwavz has done just that with the s5, i believe. the audio quality is superb, theyre as comfortable as any inear headphones that ive used, and the manufacturer has spared no attention to detail.regarding the audio quality, i didnt notice a huge difference compared to the s1 earphones, but to my ears, the bass was more pronounced  not overwhelming but very noticeable, and it sounded great, especially with bassheavy music. vocals had great clarity, and instrumentals sounded as rich as ive heard on any earphones.the s5 kit includes a variety of earphone tips, and i cant imagine anyone not being able to find a pair of comfortable tips. in addition to the mediumsize silicone tips that came already installed on the earphones, there are several other sizes and styles, including both biflange and triflange tips, and a set of comply memory foam tips. with the earphone tips properly inserted in your ears, outside sounds are eliminated or at least heavily attenuated. and if the tips arent inserted properly, the bass sounds are very weak, so its important to use the tips that fit your ears the best.attention to detail is one of the things that make fine products stand out, and with the s5 earphones, those details include a flexible ribbon cable, goldplated plugs, and a 34 screwon stereo adapter plug. and thanks to brainwavz for a really nice zippered hard case. its easily the best hard case for a set of inear headphones that ive seen.if i had to come up with a complaint, its a minor one its hard to read the 34l34 and 34r34 to know which earphone goes in which ear. the letters are on the strain reliefs, and i needed a magnifier to read them.the headphones were provided to me for evaluation and review.",the headphones were provided to me for evaluation and review.
761,"ive used this mount for 3 weeks now about 150 miles and it works great!  i was using the ibikeconsole iphone 5 when i got the opportunity to try the lite mountcase out and the immediate improvement that i liked is the smaller size.  the original ibikeconsole is significantly bulkier and larger than the case that i previously used, but the lite mountcase is thin, light and fits easily into your pocket.  the reduced size is a tradeoff for shock protection though.  while the original is shockproof and submersible, the lite mountcase trades shock proofing for an extra sturdy but not shock proof mount and uses the rainguard for water proofing.  the rainguard works awesome and saved my bacon on 3 separate occasions when i got caught in the rain!  taking all of this into account, id highly recommend the ibikeconsole lite mountcase for commutersstreet riders.  its light weight, works great and though the mount is not interchangeable with the original ibikeconsole, i actually think its sturdier.  you wont find a better mount for commuting!  if youre a mountain biker, take a look at the original ibikeconsole.  though its a bit bigger, the shock proofing and water proofing cant be beat.  i use the original on my mountain bike, and the lite mountcase on my commuter and they both work great.i am a past bike2power customer. this product was provided to me free of charge in exchange for my honest review.", this product was provided to me free of charge in exchange for my honest review.
353,just got my free sample of this case in the mail and it rocks. i do a lot of activities on my iphone and always run out of battery fast. but with the case i can be at the mall or on the road as always be assured that i have enough battery throughout my day. and dont get me started on the charging mat and how simpler it is to come home and just place your phone and the case down and you dont have the mumble jumble of all the cords and charging blocks. also another feature that other cases cant offer is that you can sync with itunes just by the case and not have to take the phone out and then plug it in.their are some problems with this case one would be that they should extends the usb cord for the mat charger as it is really small.another is that they should secure the back panel the blocks the battery and internal hardware if the case.but still a great product by unu cant wait for their other products!!!!!!,just got my free sample of this case in the mail and it rocks.

294,"let me begin by stating that i received this product from the manufacture for review free of charge.what i likeddesign  i really like the way this product is designed with the removable charging cable.  it doesnt feel like this cable will fall out and you will always have the ability to charge the battery with any open usb port on a computer or compatible wall charger.shape  this battery is shaped so that you can put it in a pocket very comfortably.  you may not be able to get anything else in that pocket with the unit but i feel that the convenience of having this battery outweighs that minor quibble.charging light  the charging leds are in a circle on the top of the unit.  a full circle means fully charged, a three quarters circle means 75, a half circle is 50 and a one fourth circle is 25.  the indicators seem to be fairly accurate.keeps the power going  one thing that i really liked about this unit is that even when the devices connected finishes charging.  the battery continues to power the device.  no unexpected shutoffs here.what could be better.size  while this item is pocketable.  you might be better off putting it in a computer bag or something.other thoughts.the battery seems to live up to its capacity in my tests.  it came to me in a easy to open box and nearly fully charged.  the external battery market is always changing and improving so its always best to look at all products offered and do your research.  they sent me a white unit with a pink cord for review.  as a guy its not really something im crazy about but im sure the black one would be a far better choice for me but it was free so thats fine.  i think this battery will make a fine backup battery to charge my phone and i had no issues with it charging or discharging.",let me begin by stating that i received this product from the manufacture for review free of charge.
120,"lets face it most of us are so dependent on our electronic devices that we cant stand the idea of not being able to use them when we want.  as a result, the external battery market has exploded with lots of sometimes confusing choices.  on one hand, this iflash power bank joins the pack with a sleek, easytouse battery.  but on the other, it does much better than others because it comes with all the extras that others dont always include  a usb cable, a selection of adapters for various devices, a travelstorage pouch, and  this is rare  a usb outlet adapter to plug into the wall.  when i travel, i can just stuff the pouch with its contents into my bag.like many other external batteries, the iflash has led lights to display the amount of battery charge remaining and a builtin, but not very strong, led flashlight.  the flashlight turns out with a doubleclick on the power button.  the battery is rectangular, with a glossy black topbottom and a white plastic, noslip band on three of the edges.  it is charged via micro usb connection, and it distributes its charge via usbtowhichever kind of port you want.  although it comes with a range of adapters, you can use your own cable specific to your device.  for example, it doesnt come with a lightning adapter, so i just use my iphone 5s lighting cable by plugging it into the batterys usb port.this size will charge my iphone 5 a little more than twice, and it gives my ipad about a 3540 charge.  this size is obviously more appropriate for smart phones than tablets, simply because the charge isnt enough to give more powerhungry devices all the juice they need however, it is powerful enough to transfer power to them, saving them from blinking out on me.  if you want a power bank to use primarily with a tablet, i recommend getting at least 8400 mah, although youll also have the added weight of a bigger battery.  external power banks always have an attrition rate when transferring power, so its not as simple as doing the math to determine the correct capacity for your needs.  most batteries have a 30 attrition rate that is, the battery eats up 30 of its charge in the process of transferring power to another device, but that isnt usually achieved until the battery has been completely drained and recharged several times.  ive found that the fourth time usually reaches the maximum amount the battery will transfer. note  i received a sample for review. debbie lee wesselmann",note  i received a sample for review.
711,"lets get the legal stuff out of the way. i received this as part of a vip program for no charge and was asked to write a review but 1i could have easily not done so if i didnt actually like the product, 2 i would have bashed it if i didnt like it.backgroundsince the smart phone revolution ive found that my phones batteries never last as long as i need them to. i shutoff bluetooth, turn off vibrate mode, and even wifi when i know i need to take or make a call. ive used several generations of battery cases in the past but treat them almost as a battery reserve and have a slimmer less bulky case that i use until the phone is nearly dead. i also used a duracell brand battery pack for awhile but it quickly stopped working and the connector port pretty much fell out. it also never had a big enough reserve to charge my phone more that 50 so it was less than ideal.when i found out i was getting one of these packs i figured i would retire my battery case and keep this charged up in my truck. i didnt expect to use it until the the work week so i plugged it in. to my surprise it arrived at 100. always being a skeptic i kept it plugged in overnight and unplugged it the next morning. fast forward to this afternoon. i got a surprise visit from my motherinlaw with my 3rd grade nephew in tow. after a few hours of playing outside we headed in grab our stuff so we could run out and do some quick shopping for lunch. thats when my nephew asked for his ipad mini and realized it was at 5. anyone with kids or that watches them knows that this could have led to an epic meltdown. instead i suggested he test out the maxboost electron. he plugged it in and we went on our way. he played the game and watched the meter count down as it recharged his mini. when it hit 97 he decided to sacrifice game play and turn off the ipad mini so the pack would charge it without the drain of him playing with it at the same time.we stopped off at a community garden and got him some ice cream for helping out. all the time his ipad mini was charging.when we got back in the car he checked it out. his ipad mini was now at 78 and the battery pack was all used up. he was impressed and also thought the display was cool because he could estimate how much juice went into his ipad without having to turn it on and check percentages.i came off today looking like a super uncle and also confident that i can use it to charge my iphone or galaxy note 10.1 instead of carrying around bulky device specific battery cases. ill update this review if i have any other issues but i also know maxboost will stand behind their products. do a separate search for my review of their iphone battery case and youll see that even though i initially got a lemon they very quickly replaced it with the only question being, what color did i want. the replacement is still working great and i am happy to support a company that offers good customer support and products.",received this as part of a vip program for no charge and was asked to write a review 
305,"lets say youve spent a long day watching youtube videos and using gps and basically running your battery down to 1.  oh no.  and now the evening hits and youre on the go, with no place to stay still and charge up.  also say you hadnt bought another unu iphone battery case before yeah i have one of those too and youre just going commando with your iphone in a regular nonbattery case.well, this does the trick.  the unu enerpack flexi is pretty much as pictured, and looks and feels sturdy.  the heft is about that of a deck of cards, the surface is a nice rubberized matte finish, and the size about the same as a deck of cards too.  its a compact little package with 4400 mah of energy.  note for comparison that the iphone 5s has about a 1500 mah battery onboard, to give you an idea of what a punch this little flexi can pack.  id venture to guess that you could do a whole day of conference calls and highbattery use and still have a little room to spare.  would it be enough to get you through a season of the wire or breaking bad?  no.  would it save you on a regular basis when you had a long trip or just didnt have a chance to plug in your phone?  you bet.in fact, the 1amp output deserves notice.  most usb ports on computers apple machines excluded typically pump out only 0.5 amps, max.  so if you have a device capable of more current draw  rapid charging, like any recent model iphone, this is good news that the flexi can pump out 1 amp.  its not quite the big current of the 2.1 amp ipad charging at maximum rate, but its still better than youll see on a regular computer usb port.now, theres this neat little usb to miniusb cord that fits right around the case as a bumpercord, thats really quite elegant.  the miniusb usually sits in a holding place, and then when you want to charge up you just plug the miniusb end into the second miniusb part marked in and then the usb part into a wall usb charger.  note that this thing doesnt come with a wall usb charger, because basically we know you already have like ten of those things lying around at home.i wish this thing had a lightning adapter instead of the miniusb thing, but thats a complaint of apple products rather than unu per se.  still, if they created an iphoneipad lightningspecific version of this though theyd need lightning for the charging in port that would be really nice.  still, if they did a true lightning connector then this thing might cost much more.  the irritation comes when you still have to bring a lightiningtousb cord with you to plug into the usb end of the unu flexi, so theres that.  not great, but not a deal breaker either.the indicator lights also are nicely executed.  a cool blue light when the power button is pressed lets you know youre in business with the number of lights indicating how much juice you have left, and theres blinking that goes on when it charges  all nice expected behavior that youd expect in any nice thing like this.oh i received a free sample for review.  theres a program through unu.  am i biased?  maybe, but not consciously.  i think this is a nice little package.",oh i received a free sample for review.

678,"many of the small external battery packs ive tested in this size range dont usually have anywhere near the capacity this maxboost electron mini does.  these small packs are what many have dubbed lipstick packs, primarily due to their size.  they can easily be thrown in a purse, briefcase, or desk drawer for whenever a charge is needed.the size of the electron is slightly larger, but the capacity is really decent.  for example, an iphone 5 has a battery capacity of 1440mah while the ipad air has one of 8820mah.  you could fully charge your iphone a couple of times and give the ipad a really decent boost.  keep in mind what you want to be using the electron for and take not of the battery capacity of the device or devices you may wish to charge.ive been playing with this one for a while and am quite satisfied with the performance.  i often like to boost my ipads because i work with them continually and even as small as the electron is i was able to keep my ipad air going without depleting it during the day.  ive got a scarcity of receptacles in this old house and the electron mini came in handy several times.one interesting feature is that the electron can identify which type of device you are using, thus eliminating the need for dual ports 2.1a and 1a.  it makes it into a plugandplay in this case charge battery pack.  simplicity does help a lot of people.  no second guessing which port to use, thereby enabling a faster more efficient charge.the flashlight, or rather the small directed beam of light, wont light up a room, but will enable you to find a lock or help you make your way across that room.  its not intended to be a torch, but i do find the addition quite handy.  with the quick tap of the power button on the side of the electron, a digital display comes on.im fine with led display bars, but many of my friends like to see exactly how much charge they have left to work with.  this is a real plus for many people.  the maxboost electron mini has performed quite well over the month or so ive had it and im quite pleased with it.  ive used maxboost in the past and would not hesitate to recommend this high quality brand to anyone.whats in the box9658 electron mini usb battery9658 micro usb charge9658 user manualfeatures9658  the world first power pack with digital display window that is capable to exhibit power level within 1 and monitor the input and output charging state.9658  this ultraportable battery pack ships with a surprisingly large 5600mah battery, which can charge almost any portable electronic devices up to 3x. i.e. iphone 54,4s3gs, samsung galaxy series, ipad, ipad mini, and almost all tablets, camera, and mp3s.9658  featuring smart port usb output, the electron mini can properly identify attached device and provide the maximum charging current to any apple and android devices up to 2.1a.9658  the electron micro features an ultra portable and stylish design and equipped with a super bright emergency flashlight that helps you through any power outage scenario.specs9658 battery type lipolymer9658 capacity 5600mah9658 input dc 5v 1a max9658  dc 5v 1a9658 dimensions 4 x 1.7 x 0.89658 weight approximately 4.3 ounces9658 input interface micro usb9658 charging time approximately 4  5 hours9658 charging cable micro usbcertificationsce, fcc, rohswarranty9658 1 year limitedsample provided for review.",sample provided for review.

673,"maxboost sent me a free sample of the battery pack for review. i used a nexus 5 with this product.with an output of 5v2.1a it took roughly hours to take my nexus 5 with a 2300mah battery from 13 to 100. after that charge there was about 45 left in the electron. when my nexus drained to 10, the electron was able to take it up to 92. keep in mind that this was an on the go test for me, which means while it was charging i was using my phone. i am a bit of a power user so if you were to leave your phone alone or use it lightly, the yield from the electron would undoubtedly be higher and faster. for iphone 55c5s users, you expect about 34 full charges with it.as for size, its about 34 of an inch thick, an inch and a half wide, and about 4 inches long. easily pocketable and very convenient. there is a button on the side which illuminates the screen to show remaining capacity.it only came with a micro usb cord though wall adapters are a dime a dozen nowadays so i had no issues with using my own adapter.i have purchased other maxboost products and have come to expect an excellent level of quality. the electron is no different and as of right now, it is my portable battery pack of choice.edit i just discovered this battery pack also has a flashlight. if you press the led button twice, it turns on. very nifty.",maxboost sent me a free sample of the battery pack for review.
436,"may 2014so i have been lucky enough to be chosen to test and evaluate another free case from unu and im so far received it  began using april 1 pleased with the newer design vs. the dx version. i figure no one wants a biased opinion so if you look at my review of the dx you will see that i update when i have used it for a while. i will list out some comparisons for everyone for the aero vs dx through the review.the battery life on this one is just as good and i expected a larger and thicker case that would be bulky in my pocket. this one is thinner than the dx version and the case is not as 34tacky34 so it feels a little slippery but i drop every case and its no worse that any other case i have used so far, but it does slip into and out of my pocket actually easier than the dx.so the case is still a 2 piece set up but on this one its the battery back and small 34locking34 front frame. it can be a little difficult to get fully locked but once it is it barely adds size to the phone. dx has a sliding top and bottom non locking casethe battery does not turn on when you unplug it you actually have to turn it on to get it to charge the phone when you need it and it charges both in a short time. dx starts sending power to phone when you unplug which then the case drains before the phone does,the charging base pad weighs nothing, an ounce or two ,and its nice not having to plug in the phone to charge it, just a grab and go whenever you need it.  the cord is short so you need an extension to be able to plug it in and put it on an end table or something. no biggie for me as i have 4 usb plug on an extension cord already.  seems no one includes a cord thats long enough.the headset opening comes with an extension although it seems a thinner wire than the dx, ill have to see if it lasts. just wish it had a plus extension that is solid and long enough to grab if it was plugged in to the bottom. my wires always seem to get caught up and separate, which actually triggers siri, odd.ill be updating this after another month or so to see if i get the 34not supported device34 issues or anything else as some electronics seem to work great for a month before issues start.",may 2014so i have been lucky enough to be chosen to test and evaluate another free case from unu and im so far received it  began using april 1 pleased with the newer design vs.

200,"most usb car chargers ive used in the past are an eye soar when plugged in to the power outlet of a car because of their bulky size. the tiny size of the yubi however provides a very clean look. you hardly notice it is there when plugged in as it only sticks out about an inch from the power outlet and the end is roughly the same diameter as the outlet. its small and light weight enough that ive grabbed my usb cable and looked around for the charger before realizing that it was already connected to the cable.although the product listing says rapid for the car charger, on the product listing and charging unit it states an output rating of 1000ma which is typical for standard charging of smartphones. a rapid charger would likely have a rating of 1500ma. the normal rating isnt a bad thing because true rapid chargers can overheat devices and stress the battery which can noticeably diminish the battery life of your device over time.i tested the charge time of the yubi against a usb wall charger for my iphone 4s. with both chargers the battery level increased by 1 per minute up until 80 when the charging rate decreased, which is completely normal. if the phone was being heavily used while charging, such as gps, the rate of battery level increase unsurprisingly diminished.in conclusion, i recommend the yubi as an affordable, very compact car charger with a normal ma rating and charge time which is a good thing for most people because of the potential adverse effects of repeated rapid charging.note a product sample was provided by the seller in exchange for a fair, unbiased review.","note a product sample was provided by the seller in exchange for a fair, unbiased review."

232,"my 4 star review reflects the device itself and not the over the top america brand.  i will address that next.  first, the battery itself is a nice little 3100mah battery that will fit easily in your pocket and give you a little extra 34boost34 for your portable electronic devices such as iphones and ipads.  the case itself is a candyshell plastic design, similar to the new iphone 5c.  in fact, it kind of looks like a small phone.  the top is a gloss black and makes you think it is either a screen or intended for something else.  the only display is 3 green leds near the usb connector that provide power status during charging or discharging.  there is 1 input port which is a microusb, and 1 regular usb output port.  that port provides enough current 2.1a to even charge an ipad, but of course, 3100mah wont be able to fully charge a totally drained ipad.  however, the 2.1a supply means it will charge things fast.  it is impressive for a small battery charger.the battery also comes with a 4034 microusb cable which is quite high quality.  i have gotten quite a few of these battery chargers to review, and often they come with really low quality cables.  this one is impressive, and the color matches the battery color you choose.  overall it is a nice effect.my conclusion is that it is a solid battery for the price and definitely garners 4 stars.  some competitive products now have charging cables builtin, multiple output ports, onoff switches, and even led flashlights, all in similarly thin profiles.  but they also cost more.  for the incredibly small size and low cost, this is a fine option.as for the 345 star america34 bit, this 34america34 marketing is really over the top.  i dont mind buying electronics made in china, but dont pretend to be a us company if you are not.  the user manual reads, 34our mission is to designed for america so that premium quality product at excellent price will be available for our customers.34  the word 34america34 appears in the user manual 19 times and on the battery itself 7 times.  the user manual states, 34about 5 star america we are based in cheyenne wyoming right in the middle of the great united states of america.....american quality  american pride34.  but the battery says 34made in china34, and the company itself is owned by fast buy international, a hong kong based company.  the wyoming secretary of state does show a 345 star america34 registered in cheyenne, but i suspect it is a holding office.in other words, buy this battery if you want a supersmall alwayswithyou battery to top off your cell phone, but dont buy it because you think it is an american company.note i was provided a sample from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review.",note i was provided a sample from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review.

1022,"normally when i receive a review sample i can do a thorough evaluation and write a review within two days. this one took longer. the reason is that it took me a while to hear the differences in this model versus thebrainwavz s1 in ear headphones, which also impressed me and i also own.after going through a pile of albums to try to understand what the product description meant by smoother bass i finally found an album that allowed me to hear itportrait in jazz. when scott lafaros bass came in on autumn leaves i started switching back and forth between this and the s1, and also hauled out some studio reference monitors. these phones are capable of going down in the 18hz range for the low end, which is lower than most in ear monitors and phones that are usually in the 20hz range at the low end. i am not sure my ears can discretely detect the differences between 18 and 20, but i was able to detect nuances that the lower end provided.these also go up a little higher than more phones, which are usually in the 20 khz range, again, i am not sure i can truly hear sounds at 24khz, but there is a discernible difference. i tested that end of the frequency spectrum with a few ahmad jamal albums since he tended towards the right side of his pianos.one other thing that took me some getting accustomed to was the overtheear way of wearing these. i am use to inear or the old fashioned overthehear phones and i had to play around with these before i figured out how to place them in my ears perfectly. if you are use to overtheear you will probably not experience the learning curve that i did.a few other features that i have come to expect from this brand are here extra tips of different sizes, a hard case brainwavz hard earphone case and a 14 adapter. i love the flat, tanglefree cable that is tougher than it feels. and it has an adjuster like a chin strap on a cowboy hat that aids in keeping these firmly in place with the overtheear way of wearing them.this is definitely a five star set of phones according to my way of grading, anyway, and one that i will not hesitate to recommend to fellow musicians. we tend to spend a great deal of time listening to music and these do an excellent job of reproducing it. my advice, though, is to take your time when you first get them because their true power is not immediately apparent. when you do start hearing the difference you will understand why i rated them so highly.",normally when i receive a review sample i can do a thorough evaluation and write a review within two days.

important information below! on the front cover there is not one word about the operation of the device inside.after bringing the charger up to a full charge i let it sit, unused and disconnected, for five days. one of the things i need in a portable charger is the ability to hold charge for a decent amount of time. hurricanes can knock the power out for weeks down here in florida.after five days i plugged the device back into the wall to recharge it and observed, by its display, that it had dropped approximately a third of its charge in those five days.after bringing the device to a full charge again i again charged my kindle paperwhite which was once again down about halfway. i then charged an older kindle 3 kindle keyboard which was displaying a low battery warning and my plain nofrills cell phone. after getting those three devices charged i tried the charger on my samsung galaxy tab2 10.1 tablet. the charger was unable to charge the tablet while it was in use. the tablet displayed a lowfaulty charging situation icon. with the table in operation and connected to the charger i could see the tablets battery percentage still dropping. with the tablet in standby mode this charger took it from 68 to 80 before being completely drained. a second test with just the samsung tablet and the charger at 100 resulted in the tablet going from 60 to 90 in about two hours when the charger was completely drained once again.in conclusion about the device its not bad. its not also something amazing. for small devices and phones its a good secondary charging solution. nice to have around in bad weather but dont i wouldnt charge it and ignore it for an extended time period. still, if you were going camping or on a weekend trip and wanted something along to make sure you phone andor kindle were usable, this wouldnt be a bad choice.now a few comments about the company that makes this charger, 5 star america. they claim this charger is designed for america american quality  american pride from the user manual and that their company is based in the united states however their device is clearly marked made in china and the writing both on the device and their incredibly sparse web page make me think otherwise. the printing on the color side of my device directs you to visit a faq page for charging instructions and legal details. the faq page does not exist.i have attempted four times to contact 5 star america since receiving the device. ive never heard back from them and im someone they asked to review their product. i dont know what luck the average consumer is going to have contacting them.update 122913  since writing this review on december 15th i still have not received a single reply from 5 star america. good luck if you need to contact them. at least this item is currently fulfilled by amazon so any returns will be handled by them. 5 star americas web page is still barely anything and their faq page is still missing. i have no faith in their customer service as of now.update 011614  nearly a month after posting this review i received an email from 5 star america. this was a reply to our initial email conversation when i agreed to evaluate their product. they out and out called me a liar for saying i attempted to contact them numerous times and received no replies. they also claimed to making several attempts to contact me. what they did was send me one email pushing me to post a review of their product. i also replied to that when i received it. to date i still have not received a single reply to the questions i sent them prior to posting my review.review dropped to one star from two. i do not recommend doing business with this company.5 star america i am not a liar. i have nothing to gain by lying about your inability to respond to email messages. other reviewers have also made these same claims of unresponsiveness on your part. your insult was completely unprofessional.",note i received this item free of charge in exchange for an honest review.

85,"note i was given a free product to test in return for an honest review.i always take either my ipod touch or iphone to the gym with me so that i can listen to music while working out.  i currently use an arm band like this one tuneband and shoe pouch, grantwood technologys armband so that i dont have to be constantly carrying around my device, looking for places to set it while im on a machine or worrying about it falling off or stepping on it.  however, im constantly fussing with the armband because it get sweaty and, since i have my earbud cord inside my shirt, its somewhat unfortable as the band is squeezing the cord against my arm.because of this, i was interested in trying out the ihangy product line.  since i have an older ipodiphone with the 30pin connection port, this product worked perfect for me.  no more screwing around with the arm band and since my iphoneipod touch is now around my neck, my headphones are also out of the way.  the connection is very secure  so secure that i had trouble releasing it  and i never had a concern that my device would fly off as i was working out.  this ihangy product also has builtin earbuds.  at first i didnt think i would like them as they seemed kind of cheap to me  or at least cheaper than my current earbuds.  however the more i used the product, the more i liked the idea of not having another cord to mess around with and surprisingly the sound quality of the earbuds is actually pretty decent.  another great addition to the product is a button that allows you to answer your phone while you are working out.  a the touch of a button, you can pick up a call which i thought was super convenient.one thing that i really really liked was the woven cloth lanyard.  i also have theihangy ihgont84655 adjustable lanyard necklace with stylus for iphone 33g44sipod  blackand this has a rubber lanyard which is both somewhat bouncy when i run and gets kind of slick when i sweat.  conversely, i felt the cloth lanyard was sturdier and felt more comfortable in comparison to the ihangy ihgont84655 rubberized lanyard.overall, i found the ihangy ihgont84709 adjustable lanyard necklace with stylus for iphone 33g44sipod to be a really great product and perfect for someone who has an older style iphoneipod touch and is looking for a handsfree option for your device.  the 20 price is also very reasonable considering the functionality that you get with the product.",note i was given a free product to test in return for an honest review.

970,"note im a software developer.i tried it with a dell venue 8 pro and windows 8.1 automatically installed the drivers without any issue. i then connected the dell to my local network with an ethernet cable and disabled the wifi and it worked without any problems.it also worked great on my macbook air with os x 10.9.2. i just plugged it in and it worked. this is great because i have no ethernet port on the macbook air.its great to take a load off the wireless spectrum when you can. youll likely get a faster connection and less interference. a device like this can also come in very handy when traveling if the wifi is not accessible or is very slow and an ethernet option is available.it is however only usb 2.0 and fast ethernet instead of gigabit. gigabit adapters like this are available, and i would get one of those if you really need the speed and can take advantage of it, but for many cases fast ethernet will be more than enough. one minor quibble is that it only has one red led light to indicate power so i wish it also had a data light that flickered during data transfer. given the price i dont find this a big enough issue to deduct any stars.this device is also relatively inexpensive. if you travel a lot and depend on your computer and have a usb port but no ethernet port on your computer, then i would highly recommend bringing one of these along with you when you travel preferably with an ethernet cable as well.note i was sent a free product sample for review.",note i was sent a free product sample for review.

865,"obviously this ipad mini case is designed with football fans and coaches in mind.  its definitely a very unique design with the outline of a football on the front and rear panels.  the leather lacing actually gives it a good gripping factor and is very comfortable in the hand.  the lacing does not have the vertical center line as it would interfere with the opening and closing with the case and would make it too bulky.  the twotone leathers, dark and light brown, are complimented by a lovely cocoa brown nubuck fiber interior lining of the folio.  fourpoint elasticized bands, partially covered with tan leather hold the ipad mini in place.  a convenient button clasp will keep the ipad mini from shifting when you are transporting it.the case itself is made of brazilian buffalo hide, much in line with the footballs made for the nfl.  the texture, however is finer.  the wilson football adds their own patented unique brand to their leather, as frieq has done to theirs.  the distinctive frieq logo is nicely blindstamped in the lower righthand corner.  the stitching is meticulously done, least ways mine is.  the cutout for the isight camera is spot one.  as this is an open style case, your lighting connector, builtin stereo speakers, lighting port connector, headphone minijack, volume controls, mute switch, etc. are easily accessed.  the depth of the ipad mini is approximately .28 inch 7.2 mm and nestles quite nicely in this case.there is a 34 plus brown ribbon band underneath the internal face where the ipad mini will go.  you have your choice of viewing either vertically portrait or horizontally landscape.  i see this case more as one that would be handheld rather than a stand alone one for viewing.  it simply seems to lend itself to that purpose for some reason.  i have several cases for my kindle fire and use them in a similar manner.  it simply makes the reading, browsing experience a bit more elegant while protecting the device.  this very unique case is definitely going to score points with the football fan.  its wellmade with a very different look.sample provided by the distributor for review.",sample provided by the distributor for review.
152,"of the many battery packs ive reviewed this is the most stunningly beautiful so far and it packs a beastly 10,000 mah that should be able to charge an iphone or any other phone several times over. and im saying this not because i received this for review unit free but because it is so.the beautyconsidering its large capacity, this battery pack, while not tiny is not as large or as heavy as i would expect. the thin slab shape and the mirror black finish yes, it does collect fingerprints and the stylish placement and shape of the 4 charge indicator blue lights and the power button almost scream high end and elegant. its something youll never be embarrassed to pull out when your phone or tablet need a charge.and, thats not all. a nice, sightly expandable nylon mesh storagecarry bag is also included and it has enough room to carry both the battery pack and the couple of wires and port adapters that you may need. all comes in black and all is beautiful and stylish.the beast10,000 mah mean that you can charge your phone multiple times before this beast runs out of juice. it should be able to fully or almost fully charge a full tablet such as an ipad 2.it comes with 2 charging ports. the 1a port is optimized for android phones while the 2.1a port works best with apple devices. its still possible to charge an android device through the apple port or and apple phone through the androids but charging wont be as efficient.to simplify the charging process, utechsmart is using a modular charging wire scheme. they provide a wire that has as usb typea connector at one end while at the other end you can plug an usb microb or minib or apple connectors, all supplied. of course, you can use your own devices charging cable.the same cable that you may use to charge your phone or tablet is used to charge the power pack itself if you plug the microb module. you can charge it through your own computers usb port very slow or, better, through any standard usb wall charger that can supply 5v1.5a.according to the manual, the power pack can supply up to 3a through the two ports. whenever the demand exceeds that for example, you try to charge two tablets at the same time, it will shut itself down to protect itself from overload damage.warranty and servicethe manual, which is written in very good english by the way, promises 18 months of warranty support from the date of purchase. my impression, based on the few emails i exchanged with utechsmart, is that this company is committed to provide good quality products to their customers and fully support them.five starsas i noted already, the product has surprisingly good high end looks, a carrying bag its important, large charge capacity, and an apparent commitment for postsale customer support. the only negatives would be the relatively large size think of a large phone and the fingerprint magnet finish but the large size is inevitable considering the large capacity and the fingerprint issue is not important enough to warrant anything but a five stars rating.",im saying this not because i received this for review unit free but because it is so.
300,"okay, first off i received a free sample to review of this product.  i have tried several different brands and sizes of backup batteries for my iphone and ipad, the flexi being the most recent.  when i first receive this product i have to be honest, i thought it was kind of silly to have a cord attached to it with one side being usb and the other a micro, neither work for my iphone or ipad.  before you agree with me, let me tell you why i quickly changed my mind about the flexi cord.  if you are like me you have several devices and more cords for those devices than you can keep track of, i quickly realized this is one charging cord i do not have to keep track of because it never has to leave the devise!  remember, you need to carry your phone charging cord and the charging cord for your battery of choice.  the unu flexi eliminates one of these cords...lets get to performance.  i wanted to put the flexi to the test, right out of the box, it was delivered on a cold day 18 degrees and it set in my mailbox until i got home from work, probably 5 hours.  i didnt expect much considering the time it set in the cold.  i opened it and immediately hooked up my iphone which was at 38, unfortunately i did not keep track of the time, but when i picked it up about an hour later, it was at 100.  i have never had a backup battery charge my phone to 100...usually it gets up to 95 in idea conditions.  this little square marvel was not done yet, i then passed it to my wife and asked her to charge her iphone...she was at 64 and it took approximately 20 minutes to jump it up to a full 100 charge.  still in disbelief i hooked it up to my daughters ipad mini, she was at 26 and continued to watching her movie while it was charging, i checked it 30 minutes later and it was only at 48, but considering she continued to use it while charging and the fact that it had already gave to 100 charges on two other iphones out of the box i was happy with my initial test.i have continually used the flexi for a week having only charged it 3 times.  i have repeatedly had great results for charging my iphone, however ipad charging is a little lengthier and if you are using it while charging you will not see any significant battery jumps but you will definitely extend the use before your ipad dies.overall, knowing what i know about this product and the convenience of the on board charging cord i feel very comfortable and confident in recommending to fellow amazon users.  what would make it a 5 star product for me would be the addition of a lightening flexi cord.  if you have any other questions about this product please do not hesitate to ask, i will respond quickly.","okay, first off i received a free sample to review of this product."
262,"okay, first off i received this unit at no cost in return for an honest review. i have used it for a week and here are my observations.1 it is sleek and has a small footprint. at 2.534 x 4.534 x 0.2534 thick, it fits easily into your pocket. it is sleek looking and shiny black. it does show fingerprints really bad.2 it comes with a usb cable with a standard size connector on one end and a miniusb connector on the other. you need to plug it into a computer to charge it or you can use a power plug that comes with many smartphones that has a standard size usb connector on it to plug the cable into. i have a motorola droid razr phone and the ac power module that came with that worked fine with this cable. the cable that comes with this battery is flat and rolls up so it has a small footprint.3 the device has a miniusb slot on the side for charging it and a standard usb connector on another side which is the output that charges your phone. so, with the cable that comes with this battery, you hook up the standard usb plug end to the battery and the miniusb connector on the other end goes to the phone. these are the only connectors that are on the battery. so, if your brand of phone uses a proprietary connector, you will not be able to use this battery to charge it.4 the battery has 3 lights to show the charge level. when i plugged it in, 2 of the lights were solidly lit and the 3rd was blinking showing that it was about 23 charged and was charging the last 3rd. when it is done charging, all 3 lights are steady. when you are using the battery to charge your phone, the 3rd light blinks showing it is charging your phone and your phone shows that the battery is charging it. as the battery discharges, the 3rd light goes out and the second one blinks showing the charge is going down. as it continues to discharge, the lights go down to 1 blinking light which means the battery is on its last legs.5 on my droid razr, it took about 2 hours to recharge the razr from 50 to 100 with this battery. when it was done, i still had 2 lights showing steady so that would lead me to believe this battery still had 23 charge left after it had recharged my razr. to recharge the battery after disconnecting from my razr took about 2.5 hours. so, i would not call this quick charging, but it did do the job. so, as a backup battery, it does the job. while it is plugged in and charging your phone, you can still use the phone, so if you are out in the boonies with little battery left on your phone, this battery will keep you going for quite some time.6 for the 13 price tag, it does a good job and will keep you from going dead when you are out and about without access to ac power.7 this battery comes in a plastic bag with a ziplock top. the usb cable is flat and rolled up so that it takes up a small space. so, when you are done, you stuff everything back in the bag  nothing fancy, but it does the job.8 for the biggest negative however, i noticed something that bothers me a lot. the company name is 5star america. the user manual states their mission as, 34our mission is 34designed for america34 so that premium product at excellent price will be available for our customers. our design concept is based on excellent american quality and value.3434we are based in cheyenne, wyoming, right in the middle of the great united states of america. we work hard to design

clearly, 34made in china.34 every where i turn, everything i buy has a 34made in china34 sticker on it. i really want to buy american goods, made in america. this has left a bad taste in my mouth as it makes me feel that the company is giving out false advertising and that made me downgrade my rating. it may work just fine and be a good value, but this is not made in america as the seller would want you to believe.this battery is useful and a good value. it works and makes a good backup battery with a fairly small footprint in my opinion. i do not like the marketing message that infers the

924,"portable speakers, especially small ones, are great for setting up in the kitchen when i am cooking. the tunephonik is ideal for anyone who doesnt want to setup a devoted sound system in an area of your home but likes to listen to music and not have to wear headphones. in this regard, the tunephonik delivers. that being said, there are some issues with the product that take what could be a great device and render it mediocre.construction  packagingthe aleratec tunephonik henceforth referred to as atp is roughly the size of a golf ball, with the speaker on top of the orb and the rest of the speaker encased in a stretchy, rubberlike material that ends with the suction cup at the base of the unit. the product description indicates that it can stick to the back of your phonemp3 player, and it does, but doing so points the speaker downward and to my observation took away the bass from the music. in addition i was unable to see my ipod touchs screen unless i picked it up. so instead of sticking it to my ipod i stuck it to my countertop when working in my kitchen. it stayed in place, and when bumped, it just wobbles a bit and doesnt fall. this is a great feature i would not want to drop my ipod connected to the speaker onto my linoleum, much less the speaker.included with the speaker unit are two cables a maletomale audio jack and a separate chargingaudio jack combo cable that also has a male jack so that you can still use it while the speaker is charging. as a plus, the maletomale audio cable is also curly think of a phone cord which allows a smaller cable while in storage, yet can be stretched if needed. the charging cable is also nice with only a minor complaint. the cable is setup in a y shape, with the microusb and audio jacks at one end and a male audio jack at the opposite end. the v of the chargingaudio end is relatively short, and when i plugged it into my laptop which i have setup on a laptop cart to charge, i was limited to a small area where i could stick the atp without it falling or being bumped by my laptop.finally, the atp does not come with any type of a storage container you are forced to find a small bag or other item in order to keep the speaker and its cables together. since the cables are not very large they are easily misplaced. this is one reason why i took off a star for my review the atp may be portable, but the lack of a drawstring bag to put everything into when i am not using it or if i am packing it for use somewhere else is frustrating, to say the least.operation  performancein terms of sound quality, the atp isx1 is pretty good for its price point. the sound is clear and there is a little boost for both treble and bass that adds just enough depth to enable the music to carry across a large room and still be able to hear the beat and lyrics relatively easily. that being said, there are a few things that need improvement, and this is why i took off the second star. unfortunately these features would require a redesign of the atp, but i strongly feel that if these changes were made, it will sell immensely well.cons1 there is no onoff switch. the device is turned on when you plug in the audio jack and remains on until you remove it.2 there is no light to verify that the speaker is oncharged, nor one to indicate that the battery is dying.3 there is no volume control on the speaker itself the volume is determined by the level set on your mp3 playerphone.while any one of these on its own would be fine, the lack of all three forces me to reconsider the product. i have one other external speaker which i did review on amazon, but i will not name it in this review that has all three of these features, including a convenience of storage on the base with a builtin audio cable to connect the speaker to my ipod. in addition that speaker came with a small cotton i think broadcloth drawstring bag that i am able to use to store that speakers cables, as well as the speaker itself. as a consequence, if i had to choose between the two i would go with the other brand.overallwhile the sound quality of the aleratec tunephonik isx1 rechargeable mini speaker is good, there are many minor flaws, ranging from a simple carrying bag to the more irritating of lacking an onoff switch or the lack of a volume control on the unit itself. that being said, other features like the suction cup are ingenious and if aleratec makes a few changes they will have a very excellent product onhand. until then, i must say that this speaker is a moderate value. if you like the aleratec brand, i recommend waiting for the next generation of this product.disclaimer this speaker was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review. while i do not feel that this influenced me in any capacity, i am legally obligated to disclose this fact so that you can come to your own conclusions about the merit of this analysis.",disclaimer this speaker was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

516,"pros in my opinion, battery life is similar to advertisment. i charged the earbuds for 2 hours. i played a song on repeat consistently in volume ranging from medium to highmid for 6 hours. i believe that normal users would enjoy greater battery longevity if the volume was kept at lower normal volume levels. i linked it to my nexus 4 phone and nexus 7 tablet jellybean and kitkat tested without any static nor interruption. i live in apartment with many wifi signals normally wifi and bluetooth may create interference, but i did not experience any with either device pairing. the range was 15 feet in my apartment, but is longer in more open areas. the cord is thin, but the material feels durable. there are a number of different size and form factor rubber ear buds caps included. ive owned about 20 earbuds headphones, and this is the first to include attachments that 34anchor34 into the ear to ensure secure adhesion. there is a soft rubber attachment that can be used to hold onto the concha of the ear. in terms of sound quality, i would recommend it for the casual listener, these sound a bit better than my sennheiser 428s.cons the clip based charger attaches to the right earbud. although it is uniquely innovative, the rubberized earbud may have to be pushed aside. i would prefer a standard microusb charger considering most people have them. lastly, i would not recommend to run with these, as they can cause irritation with rigorous movement.overall i would highly recommend these to the casual listener who doesnt like to be tethered to their audio device. my primary recommendation would be to alter the recharging component, but if it is not feasible, i do not see the issue as a deal breaker.8220i was provided with a free copy of this item for testing and my fair and honest evaluation8221.",8220i was provided with a free copy of this item for testing and my fair and honest evaluation8221.

784,"since the iphone 5 came out screen protectors have become a necessity in my opinion. the older iphones could work for a long time if you cracked the screen.  but with the new iphones the screen and the touch sensors are much closer, when you crack one you most likely cracked both of them. this results in your iphone not responding to touch commands. with that in mind i recommend screen protectors now.the lepow graphene is the best screen protector ive ever used. the reason is that its solid and not flimsy. so getting it on bubble free which is the biggest challenge with normal screen protectors is a non issue. this seriously is the easiest screen protector ive ever put on an iphone. and the protection it provides is more than some cheap 34plasticky34 type of screen protector.that being said these cost a little more than your average screen protectors but in my opinion they are so much better. plus the cost of repairing your iphone screen if it cracks starts at 99 and goes past 200, so this really is just a layer of protection.if youre tired of stupid screen protectors with bubbles that are a pain in the butt to get on then look no further.thanks for reading.ps i uploaded a customer image of what comes in the box and as always, lepow as the best packaging. they could teach amazon a thing or two thats for sure.",provides is more than some cheap 34plasticky34 type of screen protector.that being said these cost a little more than your average screen protectors but in my opinion

303,"so i received this flexi portable battery charger for review from unu, and i love it. first of all....its so cute! i love how portable it is. it doesnt take up a ton of room in my already filled to the brim purse. i used to carry an extra charger cord in my purse, needless to say everything got wrapped up in it. thats just far too inconvenient. this flexi portable battery charger is just the right size and it contains its own cord. its so convenient to have it just inches away from me after ive ran my battery down playing sonic dash or sending a million texts. also i feel much safer recharging my phone with this charger rather than the car chargers that can sometimes corrupt your battery. i highly recommend it to everybody not just women to keep in their purses but man can also keep a spare one in the car.",so i received this flexi portable battery charger for review from unu
360,"so it all started with an email asking if i would be interested in trying out products for free. i first thought 34will i really get to try out products for free or is this an email trying to get me to buy something first in order to get the product to try?34 so i hesitantly provided my email along with some basic information expecting my email inbox to 34explode34 with ads and emails from many companies...i was wrong. i received an email regarding the unu aero battery case asking for color selection for the case they were going to send me. still skeptical i indicated my color choice expecting a message indicating something along the lines of 34out of stock34 or 34product not available for test program.34 again, i was wrong. i received a congratulatory email at the end of march indicating that i was being sent the product to try with the only stipulation was that i had to write a review...so here we go.a couple of things i was concerned about when i unboxed the product1 charging plate...how would this work with my routine?answer so much easier! all you have to do is put the back of the case on the charging plate and it gives you a notification chime from you phone as if you plugged lightening adapter in and it starts charging immediately. and i must say faster at least my perspective than if you plugged it in phone directly.2 size and weight of case.answer very smooth casing and natural to hold and put into my pocket. my initial concern was that it would be bulky, but not the case.3 will the speakers be impacted?answer not that i could audibly notice. of course, with an iphone, you are not buying for the speaker performance, but occasionally when you want to use the speakerphone option you dont want any interference. again a positive.4 am i limited to the charging plate?answer nope...any micro charging cable works without the charging plate that plugs in at the bottom. this is a positive so that you are not limited to one charging solution and do not have to bring plate with you. if you do want to bring with you say on a trip, the charging plate conveniently is very packable. i just like the option of being able to charge at work if need be.5 how long does the battery last for? any impact on battery life?answer dont know...all i can say is that i have used my phone down to 20 battery and to usee the unu battery back up on many occasions. to charge your phone in the case, all you do is push the button on the back of the case and small light indicators to the left and right of the button illuminate indicating how much battery charge is left for you phone. quick and easy...but there is some heat generated from the transfer of battery power from the case to the phone...but nothing i was overly concerned about.6 what about the buttons?answer top button is covered with a plastic button cover that you press to turn on off. it took me a little to adjust to, but not not bad. the volume buttons the same. in both cases, you have to press down a little firmer than if not covered at all...but kind of what i expected. slight negative, but not anything that detracts from all the positives.7 what about the headphone jack?answer this is the only true negative that i have for the case. due to the bottom of the case, most headphones cannot be plugged in directly and this a small headphone extension cable is provided in box. this again is the only negative for a couple of reasons i never think about bringing extension cable with me still in box. a second reason this is a negative is due to me plugging in a straight headphone cord with microphone for phone use. while the cord went in somewhat easily kind of snug trying to take it out was not as successful. i couldnt believe how difficult it was trying to take the cord out after it easily went in. bottom line, the headphone with microphone not longer function...but that was my fault.8 can you charge in your car?answer? i havent tried this yet...but i will. my car has two functions for iphone music, either through the usb cord which charges, plays music, and displays content on my car stereo...and the second function is through bluetooth. since getting the case, i have only used the bluetooth option. the only time this was a concern was when i took a trip. this is the only time i took the case off of the phone and plugged directly into my car.final summary.i am a iphone case snob. i have probably gone through 5 or so cases since getting my iphone 5 last summer. many start out okay, but dont make the cut for extended periods of time. having the case over a month, i can easily say that this case is a keeper. i recommend this case to anyone that wants to have that benefit of having battery backup that is ready when you need it, easy to use, easy to charge on a regular basis, strong and stylish i havent performed a drop test and will not be...on purpose that is. this case has both 34form and function34 which even though on the high end with price point, it is worth the money.",i was being sent the product to try with the only stipulation was that i had to write a review
356,"so where to begin...this review is both of the product you see here which is awesome by the way and of the company that created it. this is my second unu case and one i was very excited to see finally made. ever since nokia really put nfc charging on the map true hps pebble used a charging stone which was also cool and i had that too i wanted it for the iphone. then one day i get an email from unu saying your wish has been granted look at the cool case we made . what made it better, was when unu asked me to test out the product and review it free sample to test and review. i was super excited and may have even played the lottery that day just in case i had any more luck left. ok, down to business, i requested the white case, seeing that my iphone is white and i wanted to keep the same look. when i got the case a couple days later, i was a little upset to see how the case was sleek and not grippy like my red unu case. then my concern shifted towards how the case assembles over the phone which is in two pieces and having a vertical seem. in my experience, vertical seem cases tend to creek and get gappy, but i put in on anyway. i was very excited when i placed the case on the charging plate to see it charging. no matter what this is a very cool feature. i mean, who wants to fuss with cords and plugs scratching your phone anyway.now for performance, the case worked as promised and is not that bulky compared to various other cases i have tried. the battery life is excellent and has no issues. sadly though, the white case is a little slippery and that gappy creeky stuff began to show its ugly face. i contacted unu and they said this is not normal and the case should be precision fit no gaps or noises. they asked if i wanted another white case and i requested the black one this time to see if it was more grippy. i was right on, the black case is more ideal. it fit excellent as stated by unu and the black case is grippy enough to not be slippery yet is still easy enough to slide into your pocket without resistance. i rock the black case daily and i must say i am very impressed with it. the charging plate is really convenient and is next level tech. the case usage is intuitive and easy to use. i would recommend the case for all the reasons above, but more so i would give my business to a company like unu who values customers opinions and happiness with their products. you normally dont get that these days. like i said, this is my second battery case from them and will certainly not be the last.great products from a great company!thanks,cazzadich"," what made it better, was when unu asked me to test out the product and review it free sample to test and review."

468,"spoiler  this is a great case, and highly recommended.  thats my take on it in short.ive been wanting a company to make an easy charging system since my first smartphone before the iphones launched.  my cordless phone in our house has used a drop in cradle for conductive charging for over a decade  why are smartphones so far behind?  well, unu finally did it  and its done very very well.i took a long time to write this review, because i found that my habits changed a bit with this case.  i always use a battery case, that didnt change, but how i used my phone did.  with my previous battery cases, id charge the casephone at night and then use it the next day, with the phone either in use or in my pocket.  with this unu case however, my habits changed.  i purchased an extra charging base to have one at the office, and one at home on my nightstand.  at the office, instead of leaving the phone in my pocket when i wasnt using it, id set it on the charging plate.  if i needed to leave for a meeting or whatever, id just grab it and go.  easy.  id never have done that with cords, plug it and unplug it all day like that, thats daft.  the unu system however made it effortless.  at night, i typically use my phone as a flashlight, and using the charging base helped this too  no more futzing with plugs in the dark, just grab it and go.  no plugging it back in when im done, just set it down.  couldnt be easier.the good about the case itself surprisingly lightweight for a battery case.  i always use a battery case, and this is lighter than my other battery cases. adds minimal bulk to your phone.  this is thinner than my other battery cases. charges very efficiently, so most of the battery pack power ends up in your phone and not wasted.  i have another battery case that offers similar battery capacity, but seems to charge my phone less. looks nice, acceptable in a professional office environment. bumper is nicely rounded, not just a flat bumper around the phone, doesnt look cheap headphone access is easy with the cutout on the case, and the included headphone plug extender charging leds are minimal and dont draw undue attention case turns off its charging when the phone is charged, so you can top it off again later. charging contacts on the case retract when not charging, so they dont extend down when youre using it.  theyre there, but you hardly notice them. soft touch coating feels nice and is holding up very well. volume and sleep buttons are covered and work well.whats good about the charging systembase very easy to use, just set it down. works reliably  it uses old fashioned, but tried and true metal on metal conduction to charge, hard to get more reliable than that. easy placement to start charging nothing to worry about when grabbing your phone, just grab and go. ability to charge with the base plate or via standard microusb cable if youre away from your base plate.system improvement opportunities as i see them anyway. bumper style case  my other battery cases use a slider style like mophie, and they are more rigid and i suspect offer more protection for the phone.  this case uses a bumper to snap onto the basebattery portion, the bumper sides have no real rigidity until snapped to the base, and even then have less rigidity than my slide style battery cases.  my other cases dont flex when i pul them out of my pocket, this one does.  you can feel the sides flex as you pick up the case.  it doesnt feel flimsy, and doesnt feel like its going to fall apart, but it flexes and that feeling doesnt inspire confidence.  this is the only reason i gave the product 4 stars instead of 5. the charging plate lays flat, it would be nice had it held the phone tilted at a viewing angle.  this would allow the screen to be visible on my desk at work, and as an alarm clock on my nightstand.  flat is fine, and this is a minor issue at best.  i actually modified my charging plate at work to hold the phone inclined at a nice viewing angle, easy diy option. the bumper around the sides of the phone doesnt extend above the screen, so if you place your phone screen down there is no protection.  i wish there was just a slight elevation above the screen, which would keep the screen off the tabletop if placed face down.  unu probably assumes youll have a good screen protector to handle that issue.  again, not a big issue. camera cutout on the back of the case has straight walls, which collects pocket lintdust and is harder to clear out.  my other battery cases have tapered sides down to the camera, and they collect less and are easier to clean out.  another minor issue.overall, this is my favorite battery case, works well, small and lightweight for battery cases and works well.  the convenience factor is very good as well.  full disclosure i was supplied a complimentary unit from unu for the purpose of evaluation and i agreed to post an honest review, which this is.  i purchased the second charging plate myself, as this system is so good i wanted to extend it.","  full disclosure i was supplied a complimentary unit from unu for the purpose of evaluation and i agreed to post an honest review, which this is."
743,"stephen m. lerchs june 27, 2014 review raised some good points about the difference between waterproof and water resistant, but i did drop my review sample in a sink full of water and the end cap sealing the ports kept it dry. of course my experiment lasted less than a minute and may have resulted in failure had i left it in the water like the picture on the packaging implies can be done.while the sound quality is not going to wow an audiophile, it is more than adequate for outside activities for which this speaker is designed. i spent some quality time listening to it about five hours a day for two days and enjoyed the music. its louder than many outdoors bluetooth speakers i have tested and used.reasons why i like this speaker and awarded it five stars are many. for one thing it can take a beating. i accidentally dropped mine on my bathroom floor and it bounced still playing music! another is it has a battery pack that easily doubles my galaxy note 3s use time and gives my tab 3 10.1 tablet another fifty percent in use time. but the main reason why i love it is i can touch my nfc enabled note 3 to the speaker and it pairs and connects. even if your device does not have nfc its simple to connect as soon as you turn the speaker on it announces that its ready to pair. scan for it on your device, touch it when it appears and it will pair and connect compare that the the older generation of speaker where you had to hold down buttons and pray and youll appreciate the way this one works.there are a few things that i do not care for. first, the instructions need to be illustrated. finding the control buttons on the same color body was like an easter egg hunt for me. also, it would help to see what the cap seal for the end that houses the port looks like in the manual.what irked me, though, is while you can skip tracks by shaking the speaker, it makes a shaker sound when you do so. at first it was cute, but i found it personally irritating after doing it for four or five songs. it would be nice to be able to turn that feature off.the bottom line, though, is this is perfect for outdoors activities and especially camping where the internal battery pack can come in handy. it is built for harsh environments, not living room listening. if you are active this merits serious consideration in my opinion.",review sample

921,"suction cup basethe aleratec isx1 portable mini speaker with its suction cup base stands out in the very populated category of portable mini speakers. the suction cup base is a wonderfully useful feature. my gripe with other chorded portable mini speakers is they are great so long as you are fine with placing the speaker and smartphone or tablet on a desk and leaving it there because holding a portable speaker attached to a smartphone or tablet for any amount of time is awkward at best.the aleratec remedies this awkwardness with its suction cup base. simply stick the portable speaker to the back of a smartphone, tablet, or notebook screen with the suction cup. you get superior sound compared to the built in speaker from a smartphone, tablet, or notebook and can easily walk around with the device or hold it to watch a video. the portable speaker is light weight and the suction cup is strong enough that it has no problem sticking to the back of a smartphone, tablet, or notebook screen for extended periods. ive stuck it to a surface, let the speaker set for a couple of hours, and it was still firmly suctioned to the surface when i came back.featuresthe aleratec portable speaker features a rubber suction cup shell that encompasses all but the top of the speaker. the speaker stays nicely in place within the rubber shell but you can easily pull it out if you so desire. the portable speaker has a very simple design. it features a single input jack that is used for both playing audio and charging. there is no onoff button or volume dial. the portable speaker comes with a short coiled audio cable and a usb charging cable. the usb charging cable is a 34y34 cable. on one end is a 3 ring connector for the portable speaker and on the other end is the usb connector for charging and a 2 ring connector to listen to music while charging.chargingmy main complaints with the aleratec portable speaker center around charging and its lack of an onoff button. when a cable is connected to the portable speakers jack, the speaker turns on, as visible by a very faint green light within the jack and the slight amount of noise coming from the speaker. i have to cup my hands around the area of the jack and rotate the speaker to the right angle to see the green light but it is there. when a cable is connected,  the speaker being on, is ready to receive an audio signal whether or not the other end is connected to an audio source. if it isnt connected to an audio source, i at times hear a faint humming sound or static from the speaker if something brushes against the other end of the cable. this can be problematic when charging because the 3 ring connector end is plugged into the speaker while the other end has the usb connector for charging and a 2 ring connector for audio. this means unless the speaker is connected to an audio source when charging you at times hear a faint humming sound or static from the speaker. while i like the simplistic design of the aleratec, an onoff button or switch would avoid this.my other complaint is there is no way to tell when the portable speaker is actively charging or done charging. the faint green light turns on whether you connect a cable for charging or to play audio. as long as a cable is connected to the jack in the speaker the faint green light stays on and doesnt turn off or change colors even if charging is complete. ive left the speaker connected to a charger for 16 hours and the faint green light just stays lit.pros1. suction cup base. stays suctioned to surface for long periods of time.2. short coiled audio cable doesnt get in the way when speaker is suctioned to the back of a smartphone or tablet.3. noticeable improvement in audio quality and volume compared to built in speakers of my iphone, ipad, and macbook air.4. simplistic design. i like that it doesnt have a volume dial on the speaker. with other portable mini speakers i always leave the volume at max on the speaker and control the volume from my iphone.cons1. no onoff button. hear faint humming sound and static at times when charging unless the portable speaker is connected to an audio source.2. because the speaker is 34on34 as long as a cable is connected to it you cant leave a cable connected to the speaker when not in use. this goes against my natural desire to keep the audio cable connected to the portable speaker when not in use so the cable doesnt get lost.3. the green 34on34 light is very hard to see.4. no way to tell if the portable speaker is actively charging or done charging.5. while the sound quality from the aleratec is noticeable better than the built in speaker of my iphone, ipad, and macbook air, it isnt quite as good as the sound quality of a couple other similarly priced portable mini speakers i have. the aleratec speaker is a little smaller than the other portable mini speakers which im sure account for the smaller sound.summaryi love the suction cup base along with the short coiled audio cable that stays out of the way. i found the aleratec portable speaker to be most useful with my iphone and macbook air. i usually set my ipad on my lap when using it so the portable suction cup speaker wasnt functional with it. the aleratec portable speaker is a good product so long as you are fine with the cons which center around charging and the lack of an onoff button.note a

226,"the 5 star america 3100mah external battery is about the size of my iphone 5, and very light and portable.  it looks like a thin smartphone with the screen turned off.  there are two ports on it one 1.5a microusb input for charging the battery unit, and one 2.1a output for charging your devices.  a set of three indicator lights roughly shows how much power is left, and blink when the battery is low.  it comes with a really nice flat, microusb cable, and it charges up just fine using my apple wall charger.other reviewers have noted that it doesnt work with their ipads, but mine charges up my ipad 3 just fine however, the ipad 3 has a gigantic 11,560mah battery, so this 5 star america battery isnt an ideal backup pack for a powerhungry tablet.  the battery pack was able to recharge my ipad from 53 to 73 before shutting off.on the other hand, my iphone has a 1,440mah battery so this battery pack is a great companion for when im out for a day.  im able to get one full charge and maybe up to a half charge out of it before the lights start blinking.  i would have liked to see two full charges since the battery pack is rated to hold more than twice the charge of my iphone battery.i havent used any other similarly sized external battery chargers, so i cant compare the performance of the 5 star america product to anything else, but a quick search on amazon seems to indicate that this is one of the smaller and less expensive options out there.my biggest gripe with this product is its branding.  not only is it gigantic, its a bit misleading.  the logo is a circle with an american flag in it, surrounded by the words 345 star america34 and 34designed for america,34 yet the product is made in china.  my review unit has some extra text on the back with support contact information and a printed link to the amazon product page to remind me to write the review.  from the product photos, it looks like the logo is even bigger on the retail product.pros very compact and light.  shorter and thinner than my iphone 5. includes a very nice, flat microusb cable. the 2.1a output port charges my iphone and even my ipad 3. charges my phone quickly. relatively inexpensive.cons doesnt charge as much as i expected from a 3100mah battery pack, but this kind of real world performance seems pretty standard for these types of external batteries. pretty obnoxious branding.overall, the 5 star america external battery is pretty good when you factor in the very low price.  i read through some reviews of other 3000mah external batteries on amazon, and its performance seems to be on par with similarly classed products.  i knocked off one star for the misleading and loud branding, and because i was hoping for slightly better performance.disclaimer  i received a free sample of this external battery pack for review.",disclaimer  i received a free sample of this external battery pack for review.

982,"the blurex wirelessn outdoor wifi rocket is one of the most interesting products that i have reviewed in recent months. this wifi adapter has such a huge antenna on it that i think you could receive wii in deep space. the total length of the antenna is about 18 inches long and is about a quarter inch wide at the tip and about an inch and a half wide at the bottom.first of all i want to clarify exactly how you use this adapter for those that may be unsure. i originally thought that this was like the typical wifi range extender that you hook up and it boost your entire wifi network. this adapter is connected to your computer and boosts the reception for that computer. it serves a very different purpose than i originally thought it would but its still very useful, just in a different way. a wii extender boosts your entire wifi signal a little bit. this adapter boosts the range on one device very significantly.i have been using this adapter on my gaming laptop that is running windows 8.1. installation was a breeze and only took about a minute. it comes with a mini disk and you need to run setup and install the drivers. once that is done you can plug it in and get started. from my living room my laptop usually has 5 bars and can pick up not only our connection but about ten of our neighbors wifi signals. when i plug this adapter into my laptop it still has five bars but it can also pick up about 40 different connections around our house. when i take my laptop upstairs my signal is reduced drastically from 5 bars to 1 or 2 bars. my internet speed is greatly reduced upstairs as well. when i plug this adapter into my laptop upstairs it brings my bars back to 5 and my internet speed back to around what it is downstairs.based on my experience it seems like this adapter will give you 3 or 4 times your normal range. that is very impressive and can come in really handy at times. there are times when we travel and utilize wifi signals at hotels, airports and various different internet hot spots. these type of connections are notoriously slow and weak. this adapter is a awesome little tool for times like these. it includes a mounting bracket and cable ties if you wish to mount it but i just carry it around. it fits in the front pocket of my laptop bag and can be carried around. the price of this adapter is very reasonable for the quality of the hardware and its strong performance. i would highly recommend this adapter, especially for the frequent traveler that carries a laptop.sample provided for review.",sample provided for review.

954,"the havit hvh91dj headphones, for the price, dont sound bad. they arent the most durably built headphones ive ever seen or used everything you can see is plastic, including the hinges, but for the current amazon price they are not bad at all.how do they compare to my favorite headphones ever, the sennheiser hd598s? the answer is, they dont. but these are also several orders of magnitude less expensive so that is an unfair comparison any way you slice it.the drivers themselves are 40mm in size and are supposedly rated for 20 hz to 20 khz, effectively covering the normal hearing ranges of normal human beings. using the website linked in my comments, ive tested the headphones and can say that what they claim about 20 hz to 20 khz seems to be correct. they also seem to be correctly match and can adequately play back your music with no drop outs. i had to get someone younger than me to verify above 16 khz as i cant hear above that any longer. and at my normal listening volume, i can hear it down to 40 dbfs.i do find the mids are accentuated and the lows are a little muddy, but with a good eq this can be brought up to my preferences. im actually pleasantly surprised at the aural quality from these headphones given the price point. with good eq you should be able to get the sound you are looking for from them. i wish they felt a little more durable, but they arent bad at all.in terms of the microphone, quality is passable. i made a skype call using them and it worked. this will work for pc gaming. it will not work for ps3 or xbox gaming.comfort. i wear glasses. ive worn these for several hours and am happy to report that with glasses, my ears dont hurt. this is good. however... what is not so good is, holy cow do these make my ears sweat! i live in a humid area during the summer, but im sitting inside, in an air conditioned space and my ears are soaked. the padding is the culprit as they are surrounded by faux leather. the padding is, however, comfortable.the headphones themselves are fairly light, meaning they are easy to travel. they dont do a great job with noise isolation, but in a normal environment they have the punch to get through to your ears and still sound good at moderate levels. the headphones also seem to be able to take a sonic beating as ive driven them as far as ive ever taken my hd 598s on my aune amp and they took it like a champ.in the end, at the price, the performance of these is hard to beat. at the price point, however, they do feel a little cheaply built. i received one pair free from havit for review purposes that came with a dead speaker in the left ear. i contacted them and they promptly sent a replacement without any hassle and these came without any issues at all.recommended.i received a free pair for review purposes.", i received one pair free from havit for review purposes that came with a dead speaker in the left ear.

942,"the sabrent 6100ma is an external battery charger for smartphones and tablets. it features 2 ports a 1000ma port for smartphones which is labeled smartphones and a 2100ma port for tablets which is label ipad. the external battery charger is a little longer and a little thicker than my iphone 4s in a case which makes the charging unit very portable. it can easily fit in a jacket pocket along with my phone, in the front pocket of a pair of jeans, or in a purse.the external charger is a great little unit to have if you use your smartphone heavily, if you are traveling, or just in case. i cant count the number of times myself or someone ive been with couldnt use their phone because their battery was almost dead or their battery died. if you have one of these charging units all you do is connect your phone to it via the phones usb charging cable. you can use your phone while its charging or just let the charger charge your phone.charging test of iphone, sabrent 6100ma,  ipadi was curious to know how useful the sabrent 6100ma was going to be as a portable battery charger for both my iphone and ipad. i charged the sabrent fully. after the battery charger is fully charged or after it fully charges a smartphone it will shut itself off which is a nice feature. it provided enough juice to fully charge my iphone almost 3 times. the sabrent charged it from 8 to 100, from 7 to 100, and finally from 4 to 85 before it completely ran out of juice. while charging it did so at a rate of 1 per minute up until 80 when the charging rate slowed which is all completely normal for 1000ma charger. all in all, i was extremely pleased with the results!after depleting the battery in the sabrent 6100ma, i charged it. you can plug the backup battery charger in to a computer or use a usb wall charger rated at 1000ma to charge it. i charged it on a wall unit. it took almost exactly 6 hours from when i started charging until when the charger shut itself off after being completely charged.on a full battery, i next tested the sabrents capability in charging my ipad. while i was extremely happy with its ability to charge my iphone, i was disappointed with its inability to adequately charge my ipad. its not a problem with the sabrent as much an example of battery chargers with at least 10,000 mah are needed to adequately charge tablets. my ipads battery was at 7 when i started charging. the ipad completely sucked the juice out of the sabrent in 1 hour 45 minutes and had only charged to 38. a full charge of the sabrent only increased my ipads battery by 31. that put the charge rate at almost 1 every 3 minutes which is the same as the usb wall charger that came with the ipad.pros1. very portable.2. can charge iphone almost 3 full times.3. good build quality.4. has dedicated smartphone and tablet port and supports dual charging.5. auto shutoff when done chargingcons1. full charge of sabrent only increases ipad battery by roughly 30. could probably only dual charge an ipad and iphone for about 75 minutes on full battery.2. power button is unmarked on top of unit, inside semicircle of 4 blue lights. with power off i end up poking around trying to find it.3. comes with no manual or literature.conclusionif you are only looking for a backup battery charger for a smartphone than i recommend the 6100mah charger. i will continue to use it to charge my iphone after all the sabrent is great for travel and can be a lifesaver in everyday situations. if you are looking for an external backup battery charger to provide sufficient charging of an ipad also than the sabrent 6100ma is not it. sabrent does make a 12000ma external backup battery charger which is the bigger brother to the 6100ma. i recommend that unit if you are looking for both a smartphone and tablet charger. in my test the 12000ma provided a 77 increase in battery to my ipad which is very usable.note a product sample was provided by the seller in exchange for a fair, unbiased review.","note a product sample was provided by the seller in exchange for a fair, unbiased review."

1001,"the sabrent usb 3 card reader is a very nice reader. in terms of connection, just plug the usb cable attached to the device to your computer. if you want usb 3 speeds, you must plug this into a usb 3 capable port. if you plug into a usb 2 port it will still function, however it will only run at usb 2 speeds for all devices.that being said, the majority of memory cards i have tap out in terms of speed whether i am using the internal card reader on my xps 8500 or this external reader. in this case, the card reader speed is not the constraint, my memory cards are.the reader is quite light and us easily portable. i use it with my surface pro 3 now to add the ability to copy files from my cameras memory cards to my surface pro 3. it works beautifully.i dont like the packaging, as it is that nasty clam shell plastic thats difficult to open. i dont know why sabrent chooses this packing as its really geared towards antitheft. since sabrent really only sells online that i can see, i dont think theft is an issue.despite the packaging, this card reader is a great deal. it offers multiple card options sdmmc, microsd and cf and is highly portable.recommended.i received a free sample for review purposes from sabrent.",i received a free sample for review purposes from sabrent.
779,"the samsung is very similar to the eachine xpower serie x2 and contains a whopping 10,400mah, which is a good chunk of power  enough to charge most smartphones about five times and an ipad at least twice fully. 10,000 mah is really the minimum you want in a power bank. anything less will have to going back to your computer or electrical outlet to keep recharging. the small handsize approximately 5.5 x 2.5 x 1 is great for packing.this power bank also holds a charge for several weeks at least. the power bank weighs a meager 8.6 ounces. it also comes with a small emergency flashlight which is fairly powerful, but using this light will eat up your battery power quickly.  it is nearly universally compatible with just about any electronic device.this device also includes two ports for charging simultaneously if wanted. one is a 5v2.1a for android and apple devices and the other is a 5v1.0a charge for most other devices.  in between these ports is the microusb port for charging  the power cord is included along with extra adapters for other electronic devices.  these are all on the narrower side.  the emergency light is on the top narrow edge of the unit.this battery pack is unique, in that, it displays the power in exact digital increments up to 99 1  99. that means no guessing from 20, 40, 80 or whatever. you know exactly how much power is left. i prefer this much more than a power bank that has, lets say, four led lights that represent 25 each. with this battery, you know exactly how much power you have and how fast you are using it up.  its a nice bright blue on the white background on the wide side of the unit with an onoff button next to it.i would suggest looking at all types of power banksbattery packs to see which one works best for you, as all are different with groups of attachments or simpler. some have smaller charge capacities and some are larger like this one. it all depends on what devices you have and how often you charge. also, check the prices on all batteries and the power! this will make things a lot easier in charging any external battery. i like this power bank more than most i own simply for its small size and big power. this product was supplied by the manufacturer for an honest review.",this product was supplied by the manufacturer for an honest review.

462,"the unu aero battery case with wireless charging is a very cool implementation to providing wireless charging to iphone devices. in addition to the battery case 2000mah, you get a charging pad that connects to an included microusb cable.first, i8217ll go into the battery case. the battery case is one of the slimmer and lighter ones i8217ve seen, and i reviewed the black matte version. i liked the feel and look of the black matte. putting the phone into the case is very easy, and unu recommends you place the phone down on the case so it8217s flat and then slide it into the lightning connector. once doing so, simply place the front 8220bumper8221 on the case and it snaps into place. it was fairly easy to remove as well, but not so easy that i found it popped off accidentally. the case works very well, and turning the charging function of the battery on and off is as simple as holding down the button on the back which, incidentally, also shows you the current battery level from 4 led lights by a single press.the wireless charging pad is so easy to use. i love that i can simply place my phone in the case on top of the pad and it begins charging. no cables, no fuss. the charging pad is very small, and is just slightly bigger than the width and length of the case itself. some people didn8217t like how small it was, but personally i liked it, because it meant it didn8217t take up much space on my nightstand when not in use. i do wish the charging pad was a little heavier, because with some kinks in the cord, it8217s light enough that it can flip over. the microusb cable is a little on the short side, and doesn8217t come with a power brick for the wall. however, this wasn8217t an issue for me, because i had an extra one lying around.both the phone and case charge when it8217s on the pad, with priority placed on charging the phone first.overall, this is a great implementation of wireless charging for the iphone 5, and works extremely well. with the combination of this and a battery case, i find that my phone rarely has low battery. when i8217m at home, it8217s much easier to charge because of the wireless charging pad, and when i8217m on the go, i simply use the battery case the phone8217s already in. combined with the slim size of the case, all of these things make this a winner. i highly recommend it.i was provided with this item as a sample in exchange for my fair and honest evaluation. if you have any questions, feel free to comment below or contact me in my profile.",i was provided with this item as a sample in exchange for my fair and honest evaluation.
336,"the unu aero case is easy to put on the phone and installs in seconds.  i have an iphone 5s and it fits the phone like a glove.  it does make the iphone a bit larger and considerably heavier, however.  not so much that it becomes a pain to carry the iphone all day, but it is a noticeable difference.  the face of the case sits flush with the phone so it does not interfere with using the home button.  there are covers attached to the case for the volume and lock buttons, and they are a bit stiff, making the buttons harder to use than usual.  since the case completely covers the iphone and also charges it, it hides the lightning port that you would normally charge your iphone with.  therefore a micro usb port is on the case8217s bottom, for when you need to charge the iphone and don8217t have the charging pad.  speaking of, the included charging pad is small, thin, and discreet.  also included are a micro usb cable to plug the charging pad in, and a headphone jack adaptor since the headphone jack is buried deep in the case and impossible to reach otherwise.  there is no power adaptor included, so you8217ll have to use the one that came with the iphone to plug the charging pad into an outlet.the case and pad work very well.  not only does the case charge and protect the iphone, but also it has a backup battery the holds enough charge to fully charge an iphone 5s.  there is a button on the case8217s back to start charging from the backup battery, and lights to show how much charge remains in the case.  when it8217s time to charge the case and phone all you do is place the phone on the charging base and it begins to charge immediately.  first it fully charges the phone, and then charges the case.  i got a message on the iphone a couple of times saying that the accessory may be incompatible, but i didn8217t notice any issues, and charging continued uninterrupted.  there are holes on the lower part of the case for the iphone8217s microphone and speaker and they work well without blocking sound.  the case also has no impact on the iphone8217s signal strength  be it cellular, wifi, or bluetooth.one thing i8217d like to mention that bothered me is that during charging both the case and the charging pad have blue leds that light up.  i found them very distracting when i was trying to sleep therefore i do not charge the phone while i sleep.all in all8230 a convenient way to charge, and carry extra power, for an iphone.i received a complimentary sample of this product from the manufacturer to review.",i received a complimentary sample of this product from the manufacturer to review.

42,these large foot files come in a five pack and they will arrive sealed in a bag so you know that they are sanitary. the bag is resealable so you can keep them stored in the same bag if you wish. each file has sandpaper on both sides and it doesnt come detached at all so you can file all you want. these files are roughly 9 inches long so they are very generous in size. the handles are made of plastic so they are flexible and it gives you the ability to rinse them off to get the dust off. after each use i rinse the file off and leave it set out to dry and it will be as good as new.i like that they are a little flexible but not too much. i have used a file before that wasnt at all flexible and it seems more difficult to file all areas of your foot with it. the grit on the sandpaper seems to be about perfect size and it can remove calluses without too much effort. i have no complaints at all regarding the quality or usefulness of these files. i have no problem recommending them.sample provided for review.,sample provided for review.

387,"they dont mention it on this product page, but after first trying out this nifty charging case on my 5s, i noticed it seemed like it might fit my ipod, 5th generation. sure enough, works for it, too, with just a touch of wiggle room.  i know this case and charger was really developed for the 5 and 5s, and using it for the ipod was not their primary intent, but because no one has mentioned it before me, i wanted to highlight that in my review. so, for those peoplelike mewho really give their ipods a workout, this is a plus.ive not seen anything like this charging design before, and im impressed. this one, both protects and charges in one fluid, concise and easytouse designthe case is a lightweight, quality plastic that can take abuse without showing wear. it has a soft, smooth feel to it without being soft, is matte black and melds nicely into the look of both my black 5s and black ipod. i love the slimness of the 5s and this case keeps a low profile and maintains the slim design of the phone while protecting it. in most instances, the protective case will keep your phone safe, but if you are prone to dropping your phone and stepping on it, you probably should look for a tougher case, but youll lose the slimness of the 5s by doing that. the case comes in two pieces, top and bottomback, that snaptightlytogether to frame your phone. with all the color choices that they show for the galaxy, i would expect the color selection to expand for the iphone, too.the battery is incorporated into the back of the case, how clever is that? and it is a potent, powerful battery at that. even though it is part of the case, it is not secondary to the case the battery charges quickly, holds the power, and provides enough oomph to keep your device going for an extra 10 hours. cords come with the set.the back of the case has two tiny silver metal bumps that act as connectors to the charging mat. plus, you can buy additional mats and leave one at home and one at work, or wherever is convenient. keep your mat plugged into a usb hub and toss your phone onto it to charge. you dont really appreciate how easy and convenient it is until you try it once!this is a top quality, wellconstructed case and charging mat. its design works with the look of your 5s, 5 iphone or ipod, 5th generation latest. it is so convenient and effortless to charge up with this new unu design. i love it, and highly recommend it! this company has a hit on their hands! in my opinion, good value for the money.i received a sample product from unu electronics.",i received a sample product from unu electronics.
296,"this 4400mah external battery pack is about the size of two compact mirrors, one on top of the other  it fits in the palm of my hand. the usb cable, both for input and output, wraps around the body and tucks securely into each end so youll have either all or part, depending on your device, of the necessary parts in one package. it measures approximately 2.75 x 4 including plug ends x .75.i like that it gives me iphone 5 a couple of charges and can also give my 3rd generation ipad an emergency charge, albeit a slow one in the ipads case. the phone also charges more slowly however, i can get a full charge in two hours or so, not that different from the usual 90 minutes. for both the ipad and the iphone, i have to use separate cables since the onboard cable can only charge those devices with a micro usb charging port. if unu made a iphonededicated enerpak with a lightning cable instead of a microusb, id be the first in line to buy it. id love to be able to stash this in my handbag without having to also remember a lightning cable. note i received a sample for review. debbie lee wesselmann",note i received a sample for review.

402,"this battery case is a great way to provide a little extra charge for your iphone 5s when you are far from a power cord.  the case itself comes in 2 parts.  you snap off the outer ring, slide your phone onto the included lightning connector, and then snap the outer ring back into place.  the case itself has a rubberized outside and feels good in the hand.  the power switch and volume switches are covered with rubber, but there is a cutout for the silent toggle.  the bottom of the case has a microusb plug, so an added benefit of the battery case is you can now charge your case and your phone without having a lightning connector nearby.one downside of the case is that the headphone jack is so recessed that most headphones wont fit in it.  the manufacturer provides a 34stub34 cable which you will need to keep with your favorite pair of headphones.i was also a bit surprised to find that the charging isnt wireless in the sense that it is inductively charged.  instead, you get a pad with 2 metal contacts on it.  the back of the battery case has another 2 contacts on it.  when the two touch, the phone charges.  so in fact, its not exactly wireless, but it plugs it with gravity instead of a cable.  in that sense, however, the system does work quite well.my only real complaint is that the case doesnt really bump out in front of the screen at all, providing minimal impact protection if you drop your phone on the screen.  if they were to add some lip in the front, this would be a perfect case.  since i am a little concerned here, i rate it 4 stars overall.note i received a free sample for review.",note i received a free sample for review.

829,"this device is one small item that really packs a punch. it is able to charge all my familys smart phones at once or my cellphone samsung galaxy note s3 and my tablets kindle fire hdx and ipad air . its all about the amps there are 2 smart ports forup to 2.4a think ipads and tablets and 2 ports for up to 1.5 amps think smart phones. the otg port cannot be used for apple products esp ipads.whats really unique about this little gizmo is that it can charge both a phone and a tablet in about the same time as having multiple chargers going and is much safer since youre not overloading your home w all these additional plugs esp in summer months in the south where the electric companies are forever telling you to unplug items even on strips while storms are coming or the temperatures are unseasonably high and everyone is using their ac.most of these devices do not come w the otg cable but thats not the case. the manufacturer has thought of everything by including the cord with this unit.people ask me what the otg port does. otg for those of you who arent too computer literate yet means on the go.simply stated it 1 x otg port allows instant readwriteview access to any usb storage from android devices. need to use provided otg cable. again this will not work on apple devices!!while the manufacturer doe label the port for an iphone and one port for android it is not limited to either one. what this actually tells you is that it these two ports together cannot exceed 1.5a!this item is extremely compact  portable palm size 4.331.3and so this  makes it ideal for international travel or domestic travel. either way it will fit very easily into a pocket of a tote bag or a fanny pack. package includes 1charging station 1detachable power cord 1otg cable for android 1user guide.make sure you take your users guide just in case you have any questions.one thing thats invaluable to me is having 247 email customer support and hootoo is known for their outstanding customer support making it one of the best electronics companies on the market today. heck even sony doesnt offer 247 customer support unless you pay for it..this is free.most of these units dont have any safety features and yet this product is loaded with them. seems hootoo is all about safety first! which for me when you have a family is an absolute must have.it has over charge protection, surge protection heck my neighbor just lost a tv and a cable box by not having a surge protector on their box and tv..this to me here in the lightening capital of the world is fantastic, and it even has short circuit protection. can you ask for any other protection? i cant think of anything that hootoo didnt cover. oh yes..it does come with a 12 month hootoo warranty and 247 email support.this device is compatible with all usbcharged devices with a few exceptions. the asus transformer and ipod are not compatible with this device but w the ipads and all the other phones like iphones etc this is still a winner for hootoo.one thing i did want to mention about android devices. in order for this to work with the otg it must be updated to android 4.2 or later. my samsung galaxy note s3 worked fine..plug and go.finally i just want to let you know about this device that the otg function cannot be use to actually charge the device only read.this device at even double the asking price on amazon.com is worth every penny. it literally eliminated tons of extra charging devices and cords that were scattered all over my home. simplicity and being able to keep up w the kids devices and my own all in one place is truly a blessing.i was actually sent this device by the manufacturer to test and review. this review is my own and nobody including the manufacturer had any influence over my opinions or reviews.",i was actually sent this device by the manufacturer to test and review. this review is my own and nobody including the manufacturer had any influence over my opinions or reviews.

189,"this four port usb wall charger works, but its bulk and low output when using all four ports just doesnt compare to another fourport outlet that i own. although this wall charger is designed for travel, you have to manually attach the prongs or leave them attached, which in either case doesnt make for a compact package. id much rather have the prongs fold into the body. and if im going to have four ports, id like to be able to charge four devices at full speed. other wall chargers that i own have at least one 2.1 amp port for charging an ipad, and this remains constant, no matter how many other devices are attached. not so with the etronic quad port.i tested this with four devices  ipad, iphone, ipod, and kindle  all of which had 50 or less battery charge remaining. to mimic what i would do in a hotel room, i plugged them in using the etronic quad port before going to bed and unplugged them first thing in the morning. all four had full charges by morning. the sticking point, however, was the ipad, which displayed not charging after a few minutes of being plugged in. still, it continued to charge. this also happens when i plug the ipad into certain usb hub ports because there isnt enough power running through them. it charges, but at a very slow rate. using the etronics with the ipad and other devices at the same time was the equivalent of using a lowpowered usb port on my computer.this wall charger is okay if you wont include a tablet in your four devices or if youll always use it overnight. in fact, its quite convenient to be able to charge four devices from one power source. note i received a sample for review debbie lee wesselmann", note i received a sample for review debbie lee wesselmann
129,"this iflash 8400 mah power bank has roughly the dimensions of two decks of playing cards stacked one on top of the other, and that means that it fits nicely in the hand or in a travel bag pocket.  it has two output usb ports and a micro usb input port.  the led flashlight, activated by double clicking on the power button, is slightly more powerful than most found in power banks, so it becomes a useful tool rather than a headscratching addition.  the amount of power remaining is displayed by four blue led circles.ive learned a lot about power banks over the past couple of years, and one important consideration for those new to buying one is the power transfer attrition  that is, the amount of power lost when transferring a charge from the battery to a device.  you cannot simply do the math to determine how much power you will get.  for instance, if you took the capacity of the 3rd generation ipad battery and divided it by 8400, you might expect a 73 charge from this power bank.  the reality is quite different  and not unexpectedly so.  i get approximately a 50 charge on my 3rd generation ipad from this iflash battery, about average for a power bank.  expect a 30 attrition rate from this battery.the two output usb ports are 2.0 amps and .6 amps, the first necessary for more power hungry devices like the ipad.  the .6 amp output port will charge my iphone 5 lightning cable not included, allowing me to charge both devices at once, although i have been unable to tell whether the battery gives priority to one port or the other.  the construction feel solid and looks sleek.the black version it also comes in white has a glossy black case with a white stripe running across three sides.  as with many black glossy electronics, it is a fingerprint magnet.  i like the white stripe, however, even though it detracts a little from the aesthetics  i can locate it easier inside my briefcase than i can an allblack battery.  it comes with a selection of adapters, two charging cables, a vinyl storage pouch, and yes! an ac wall charger.if you are looking for a battery that can charge a smartphone several times  about 5 charges for my iphone 5  or that can give a boost to your tablet, then this is a solid option.  note  i received a sample for review. debbie lee wesselmann",note  i received a sample for review.

214,"this is a slick, nicely designed except for the back of the battery and built battery pack. it is a dead ringer for an iphone 3, the face is the same size as an iphone 3 or 4 and it is about the same thickness, the back edges are rounded just like the 3. it cant be beat putting it in my pocket while charging my phone  it mates perfectly with my iphone 4s.there are 4 pale blue leds that indicate charge level. they are slightly visible through the face and a bit brighter looking straight on toward the usb port. the box includes a very nice looking microusb cable to charge the battery.i was able to charge my iphone 4s from about 20 to full 100 with 2 lights left on. meaning, i can get almost another half a charge on my iphone. it does charge an ipad at full high speed the battery does output 2 amps. this isnt something youll want to do regularly it only boosts the ipad air about 40.the battery looks great from the front it has a great form factor, and does a good job charging. all isnt so wonderful with this battery though. there is this massive logo on the back of the battery that cannot be removed i guess you could cover it with a skinit cover for an iphone 3. the whole thing is butt ugly  a great big stylized american flag circle, directions in big white type, and 10 white circle logos for cautions. all that would be kind of ok in a roundabout way. but wait, the thing is designed for america but made in china. there is just something wrong with all this flag waving and making things in china. sorry, the irony is just too great for me. i do understand that every lithium ion battery is made in china there is no way around that fact. but dont wave the us flag in my face while you do that.there is another small problem, because there is no power switch or test switch on the battery, the only way to tell how much charge is on the battery is to plug it into a device or start charging it with a microusb cable. virtually every battery ive seen lately has a button to show the charge level. if im grabbing this battery for the day, i darn well want to be certain it is fully charged. cant do that easily with this battery.in the end, if you dont mind the american flag waving and using a product made in china every portable battery is made in china, and you dont mind the inconvenience of figuring out the charge level of the battery this is an excellent battery for charging cell phones. the price honestly cant be beat. when i consider price in the equation this is a much better battery.i was provided a review sample.",i was provided a review sample.
935,"this is a stellar model not only was i impressed with its durability for more see paragraphs nine and ten and speed, but also its sleek glossy design.it8217s extremely easy to use and understand if you only want to know the basics which is about all i can explain. powered by its internal lithium ion battery, it has three ports, one of which is an input port, and charging an uncharged battery charger is listed at about 56 hours but i found my first charging took hours less than that. the other two are output ports one that is labeled 8220ipad,8221 and another that is labeled 8220smartphone.8221 both output ports fit a standard usb cable, whereas the input uses a micro usb cable. a 68221 usb to micro usb cord is provided.should you want to know a little more, ill try my best. the ipad output is 2100 mah or 2.1 ah, and the smartphone output is rated at 1000 ma or 1 amp.  the total output is listed at 3100 ma, or 3.1 ah, but that counts both output ports working simultaneously.i am not an electrician, but the 6100 mah seems to be at good higherend charger for its size. i charged my kindle hd fire from almost dead to completely charged in under three hours, but please note ,the rate was not uniform8230it charges the first three quarters of your unit more quickly than it did the final quarter8230which i understand is quite normal.  and it shuts itself off when the device it is charging reaches its limit to avoid overheating.likewise with my smartphone i purposely let my cellphone discharge, then charged it with my sabrent8230the phone took about an hour to charge about 50 to 60  higher than it had been meaning that if it started at about 20  it was at about 75  roughly within the hour.and, according to the manufacturers, the charger holds enough power to charge at least three cellphones before needing to be recharged itself.i have seen that some others of close to this size have more capacity 8211 sabrent has another model which is a 6600 mah, and another at 12000 mah which i also reviewed 8211 but this seemed to me to provide an entirely satisfactory charge for most purposes namely, day trips.as i mentioned, it8217s extremely sleek and attractive, too8230it8217s exactly the kind of lustrous, shiny black plastic and chrome that i8217d like to picture on a tabletop in my futuristic apartment.  granted, in the here and now it sits atop my cluttered coffee table near a bunch of magazines and litter, but it still looks beautiful. when it is charging or discharging a series of little blue lights indicate its progress, and they look beautiful also.i was particularly impressed about a week ago, and then two days later, when my old, clumsy fingers fumbled with the charger and dropped it first, on a linoleumcovered wooden floor, and second, on a concrete floor8230albeit covered at that time with a rumbled shirt. regardless, both falls and their conclusions! were sudden and hard, and either fall could have broken it, or at least inflicted severe damage.but nothing8230well, almost nothing. the second fall separated the upper and lower halves of the black case8230but only by a small portion of an inch. with a minor adjustment the two halves fit back together and it hasn8217t suffered a whit. it works as well as ever and hasn8217t a blemish on its shiny plastic shell.about the only areas that i would ask for improvement s are the following1. there are no real instructions provided. sabrent does have a website ... that will provide you with a manual.2.  i believe it could use a longer adapter cord8230the sixinch one that is included with it is fine, but i have run into several situations where a longer one was required. still, it8217s nice to have a short cord around for use in certain settings.3. i left the most important for last the unit has an offon switch that is almost impossible for you to know about unless you download the manual. if the unit lies upon a table, leaving the word sabrent visible, trace your finger from the s in sabrent a little more than halfway to the 8220smartphone8221 port. your finger should not leave the top of the charger8230once you are about halfway, press down four lights will light up in a semicircle. your unit is on.all in all, the sabrent is a striking and efficient charger that is no larger than the items it charges, yet it has power aplenty for momentary fixes and more, depending on your need. it serves well for what it8217s intended to be a stopgap problem solver for those times that you realize your trusty cellphone, ereader or other electrical device is out of juice.one final note i was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review  which this is.",one final note i was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review  which this is.

785,"this is a very nice glass screen protector. it comes with everything you need for an easy and clean installation, and it is very nicely packaged for secure delivery.what i really like about glass screen protectors is that they go on easily, and they dont warp or bubble when there are minor pieces of dust. with the plastic protectors, almost anything, however miniscule, will create a bubble, and it is very difficult to avoid that. i tried, several times. glass screen protectors, by contrast, only warp or bubble when there is something fairly large and visible underneath them. this one went on clean the very first time. i just followed the instructions, cleaning my screen with the included wet wipe and then the included microfiber cloth, and then i removed the protective screen, laid down the glass gently, and ... it was on, perfectly!once it is on, it will do a significant job protecting your screen. i would hate to be without some kind of screen protector. any time you have something you are constantly handling, pulling out of your pocket, setting down, picking up again ... theres the chance that sometime youll fumble and it will fall. if the floor it falls onto is concrete, and not carpet, it is likely to crack.i know this first hand. i had actually never dropped my phone, but the other day, a few weeks after id installed this screen, i got a call, picked up my phone quickly from the table itd been lying on, and i fumbled. it fell and landed face down on the hard tile floor. the screen itself was protected, but the glass screen protector chipped slightly on the corner, and there is a slight, barely visible hairline fracture in the protector that extends from the corner to the microphone opening.im very glad i had the protector on, as otherwise i might be dealing with a chipped and cracked screen. as it is im dealing with a slightly chipped protector  and i can handle that. note i received a sample of this product for the purpose of testing and review, and im very glad i had it on when i dropped the phone.","received a sample of this product for the purpose of testing and review,"

147,"this is my review of the iflash ultra slim 3200 mah power bank. it came with a micro usb adapter and an apple adapter for apple devices before the lightning connector. now power banks are usually pretty big and bulky to compensate for the battery charge that they are holding, this one is unique. this power bank offers a 3200 mah back up which is enough to charge phones with small batteries not smart phones quite a couple of times and a smart phone maybe about 1 time and then another half charge. this power bank conserves battery life unlike other external batteries though, the battery indicator on most power banks light up when charging a device and that lets you know how much percentage of a charge the power bank still has, this is great but those lights that are always on can reduce the overall performance by using up some of the stored energy.when you connect a device to this power bank it immediately commences to charge, but the lights remain off! this helps improve the battery life of the iflash power bank, a neat feature that makes this one such a good power bank. this power bank also incorporates a built in micro usb cable on the right side of the product, it is a couple inches long so it isnt that long, but just having the option of using it makes it that much better if your device charges via a micro usb cable. this addition makes it not only more usable, but more portable because you dont need to carry around the cable for that such device.the best feature of the iflash 3200 mah powerbank, at least to me, would have to be its design, it is an amazing design and it looks amazing. it is ultra slim, it is about a third of the thickness of my phone and unlike other power banks this one is so slim and small that you can even fit it in a pocket if you really wanted to.the only con to this powerbank is that its output is at 0.6 amps, not necessarily a bad thing it just means that the rate of charge isnt going to be as fast as if you connected it to a charger with a 1 amp output or 2.1 amps. i would say that although this power bank is capable of charging tablets and pretty much any device that charges via a usb port it would be more suitable for phones in general that dont have big batteries such as the samsung galaxy devices since those would be better off charging at a faster rate.overall i can highly recommend this product, you will be sure to enjoy it and you wont regret purchasing one.i rate this product a perfect 5 stars out of 5 stars!i was provided this product for testing and evaluation and my review of this product is completely honest and unbiased, the words stated above are my own.","i was provided this product for testing and evaluation and my review of this product is completely honest and unbiased, the words stated above are my own."
564,"this is my review of the maxboost electron plus 15000mah battery pack.  so, first at the start, i was sent this item from the company for the purpose of evaluation.in preparation for this evaluation, i have attempted to use the product in a variety of situations involving myself and others.first, the battery pack comes with its own protective cover bag and a 8220universal8221 cord for either charging the unit or using the unit to charge other devices.  the cord is usb on one end and a plug in end to receive one of the three provided ends mini usb, micro usb and the larger apple end pre iphone 5.  so, at this point if i have one negative it would be that there is no lightening pin adapter included with the product.second, in holding the unit, you will immediately notice that it is well constructed.  it does not feel cheap at all.  the unit can either be turned on by pressing the button on the side, or by plugging in an item to be charged.  in addition, there is a flashlight feature that is turned on or off by two quick presses of the button.  when the unit is turned on, there is a digital display that informs you of several pieces of information.  first, you know how much of a charge is left in the battery pack.  this is displayed numerically, counting down from 100 full charge to zero.  second, you are informed as to whether the unit is charging or discharging, and third you are informed as to which level of discharge is taking place.the battery pack offers to levels of charging capability.  5v 1.0a or 5v 2.1a.  this allows you to choose your level of charge, or to charge two devices needing different levels of charge.  for my purposes, i used the battery pack to charge both my iphone 5 and my ipad air simultaneously.  i experienced no problem, as the battery pack was able to charge both without issue.third, charging the battery pack itself. the included cord can also be used to charge the unit.  in between the usb ports there is a micro usb port for charging the battery pack.  i charged the pack from both my computer and from a wall outlet.  both methods worked fine without a problem.fourth, i also gave this unit to my daughter for her to charge her iphone.  i gave it to her without any instruction and, quite frankly, she had no problem figuring out what to do in order to charge her phone.up until this unit, the battery pack i carried with me was only capable of charging my iphone 5 partially and would not work with my ipad.  now this battery pack is always in my backpack.final word this is a simple to use unit that charges everything i need it to charge.  it is easy to use, built well and is worth taking a good look at if you are considering purchasing a battery pack for your electronics.  my only request is to include a lightening pin adapter.i would have no problem recommending this to a friend.","  so, first at the start, i was sent this item from the company for the purpose of evaluation."

176,"this is my review on the bolse aon 4 power bank which i have now been testing and using for a period of 6 days. when you first open the box inside are1 the power bank its self2 an instruction manual3 a carrying bag for either the power bank, or all of its included accessories4 multiple device adapters for many different kinds of phones, some of the more common are the apple 30 pin connector, a micro usb adapter, and a mini usb adapter5 also included is the charger for the unit its self which connects to a wall outlet, for faster charging than other power banks.6 multiple adapters to charge many different types of large devices such as laptops, cameras, etc.the aon 4 is one of the only power banks that i have seen to be able to charge devices such as laptops, this is available because the unit offers 3 power outputs. the two usb ports charge at 5v, 2.1 amps, which is definitely a good power output and it charges your devices faster. these usb outputs can both be used at the same time simultaneously. as for the charging of laptops, not all laptops can be charged, make sure the adapter for yours is included otherwise if you are purchasing this unit specifically for charging you might not be able to charge it. if it is supported, there are the options to charge at 9 volts or at 12 volts. on the device, there are blue light indicators that represent how much battery is left in the power bank. one light on represents 125 battery, 2 lights represents 2550, 3 lights represents 5075, and 4 lights indicate that the unit has 75100 of its battery left. at 10,000 mah you dont need to worry that much about the power banks battery unless you are charging devices with large batteries such as the ipad 3 which has a 10 hour battery. this unit wont be able to bring back an dead ipad 3 to 100, but it will restore it to about 7080 battery levels. it will definitely charge smartphones multiple times, most smartphones have batteries that are relatively small 10002000 mah. the unit its self looks very nice, the front of the power bank does seem to attract and gain a lot of fingerprints because of the material. overall this power bank is one of the best that i have used and it offers a lot with charging outputs of 9v and 12v. this is an essential product to have if you are a user of smartphones or tablets which are constantly consuming battery life. this removes the need to be near a wall outlet to charge your devices and gives you the freedom to charge a device anywhere you are whether its at school or at work or any other place where you would normally not have access to a wall outlet. i rate this product a perfect 5 stars out of 5 stars!i hope this review of the aon 4 has helped you out!i was provided a sample for evaluation and testing of the product, my review of this product is honest and fair.","i was provided a sample for evaluation and testing of the product, my review of this product is honest and fair."
163,"this is my review on the bolse aon 5 external battery pack, i have been using and testing this product for about a week and a half now. my first impressions on the aon 5 is that it is pretty big however, it would be great to carry around in a backpack or a purse. included with the aon 5 are multiple adapters for various phones and devices, some of the more popular ones include the micro usb adapter, mini usb adapter, and the apple 30 pin adapter. you are not limited to the charging adapters that are included, as long as you already have a charging cable for your device and it charges via a usb port than this battery pack should be able to charge it. along with the adapters that are included you will also receive the instruction manual and a carrying bag for the unit its self or the adapters. what is really neat about this battery pack is the fact that it can charge 5 devices simultaneously! each one of these different usb ports offer a different outputusb port 01 samsung dc at 1.3 ampsusb port 02 ipad dc at 2.1 ampsusb port 03 ipadiphone at 1 ampusb port 04 ipadiphone at 1 ampusb port 05 universal at 0.5 ampsthe battery pack its self is very stylish and looks amazing, it is kind of on the big side, but isnt really heavy. the black material that you can see in the pictures do attract a lot of finger prints, but this isnt much of an issue to me. offering a battery size of 11,000 mah it offers a lot of battery and thus can charge most smartphones multiple times. most smartphones have batteries between 10002000 mah, some have bigger batteries, but as you can see this battery pack can charge these devices multiple times and still have left over battery. you can tell how much of a charge the battery pack still has by the 5 led lights that it has, each blue light represents 20, so if one light is lit then the battery pack has 120 of a charge left, 2 lights lit means that it has 2040 of a charge, 3 lights it means 4060, 4 lights means 6080 and 5 lights lit means 80100 of the charge remaining. this battery pack is great for travel with the family or just for a single individual that might have multiple devices or simply wants it for its large battery size. having one of these battery packs is a smart choice in our world today as many people now have phonestablets that are constantly draining battery life and are power hungry. having a portable battery pack eliminates the need of worrying that your device is going to run out of battery no matter where you are since you dont need to be connected to a power outlet in order to charge your devices.overall i havent experienced any difficulties or issues with the aon 5 and i rate it a perfect 5 out of 5 stars!i hope this review helped you out!i was provided a sample product for testing and evaluation, my review of this product is honest and are my own words.","overall i havent experienced any difficulties or issues with the aon 5 and i rate it a perfect 5 out of 5 stars!i hope this review helped you out!i was provided a sample product for testing and evaluation, my review of this product is honest and are my own words."
138,"this is my review on the iflash 5600 mah external battery. this power bank works great and i tested it with my htc evo 3d and my ipad 3. now before i move on, note that the description for this item doesnt state that it is for the ipad although it can charge it. from my testing i observed that it does charge the ipad, but at a very slow rate of charge, due to the ipad having a very large battery its overall percentage doesnt charge that much. if you are using the tablet, because it is a big power consumer due to the large screen on the tablet, it will discharge instead of charge i had it on almost full brightness.this power bank works perfectly with all other devices that i have tried though! it recharged my htc evo to full charge and the results were the same with other phones and electronics that i used. this power bank has a built in flashlight that can be accessed by pressing the power button twice, and it is turned off by repeating the action. it has a nice weight to it and it is small enough to carry around without any inconvenience. you can read the power banks remaining battery life by pressing the power button once, it is indicated by blue light circles. each one represents 25 so if 4 lights are lit than it has between 75 and 100 of a charge left. it has performed well, and it has a decent battery for charging smart phones and small electronics a couple of times before it running out of power. if you are looking for something to charge larger electronics such as tablets, then i would recommend going for a larger capacity power bank that has a larger output, preferably 2.0 amps or 2.1 amps.in the end it depends on what you are looking for in a power bank.overall i really like this iflash power bank, it is small, portable, and stylish. it certainly charges well and seems very durable. i rate this product 4 stars out of 5 stars!i hope this review has helped you out!i was provided this product for testing and evaluation, my review of this product is completely honest and the words stated above are my own.",i was provided this product for testing and evaluation

341,"this is my second unu case, my previous daily driver for my iphone 5s was the unu dx case which was outstanding.  this case, the unu aero improves on most of the minor design complaints that i had and takes the platform a step forward in convenience that i very much appreciate.  that being said, lets tear into the particulars.designwhen comparing this to the dx line, it is slightly thinner and shorter which helps the iphone avoid crossing on into the bulky category.  any case that incorporates a battery however is going to require additional space to house that extra juice.  i think its an easy choice and i would choose battery and protection over protection alone any day of the week.  the volume and power buttons are covered on the aero open  uncovered on the dx and this was a welcome change.  having what i consider to be fairly average size hands, trying to mash my index finger into the space to adjust the volume was possible on the dx, but its not an issue at all with the improved covering on the aero.  as it was with the dx, the black case is a matte black which has a better tactile response where as the white case is more high gloss and slick.  installing the phone is easy enough, the front and back of the case separate, plug your iphone into the lightning port on the back of the case and gently snap the front of the case over it from top to bottom.another element that i appreciate is the usage of micro usb.  the charging base is powered by micro usb and the case itself has a micro usb plug that you can use to charge the case directly should it need a recharge while you are away from the base as well as sync the phone to itunes.  as the case connects to the iphone via lightning port, it does stick out from the bottom slightly restricting access to the headphone jack.  an extension is provided and is required for any headphones with a 90 degree plug.my one complaint on the design aspect is the absence of a screen protector.  the screen cover staticstand alone... not mounted to the case itself, included with the dx was fantastic, despite having gorilla glass on the 5s, i very much appreciated having that and was disappointed that one did not come with the aero.protectiona case, even a battery case, should offer protection from lifes bumps and bruises.  having used this case the last few weeks exclusively it seems to be holding up very well.  while i have not had any major impacts or drops, i am on my phone extensively most days and my phone is in and out of pockets, cup holders, cars, etc before it finds its way back to the charging mat to rest and recuperate.  there is a very slight lip around the edge to keep the screen off a surface if you were to lay it down on the screen, but if its a coarse surface watch out.  better yet, dont put it down on the screen side to avoid potential heartache.chargethere are two elements to the charging system, one is charging the phone when you need it on days of heavy usage.  the other is recharging the entire platform when your case is depleted.  both are easy, quick, and very straight forward.on the back of the case is a button.  a brief press will alight up to 4 blue lights which represents the level of charge for the case, each light represents up to 25 so 1 025 2 2550 3 5075 4 75100.  a longer press  hold, say 3 seconds or so, will initiate a recharge of the iphone and without user intervention it will charge the phone to 100 and then stop charging.  on the back of the case are two recessed metal nubs, when they are placed in contact with the charging base the charge will begin.  this connection is slightly magnetic which helps to hold the phone in place.  it is not, however, strong enough to hold when you pick up the phone or to keep connection while inverted in case you were hoping to mount it on the underside of a desk or on a wall. the battery is 2000 mah which is rated to charge approximately 80 of the 5s.  in my experience, this is pretty close to real world use.  i typically charge when my phone reports between 20  30 battery remaining.  at the conclusion of the charge, the case reports 12 blips remaining.  dont be fooled by the second light, its much closer to 26 than it is 50.using this case i can usually squeeze 2 days out of my phone before it needs a full recharge.when plugged in directly or placed on the charging surface the initial charge is directed to the phone.  once the phone charges to 100 the case will begin to recharge.  if both phone and case are almost exhausted, expect to leave it on the charger for a while to get everything back up to full.  ive always been able to get through to the end of the day and then let it charge overnight. summary with a little less than a month of constant usage under my belt, i am very pleased with the case and the charging system.  if charging without plugging in is a major goal with this purchase, you may want to pick up a few extra charging bases 25 at the unu site so that you have at least 1 for home and 1 for work.  having a microusb connection on the case itself makes that a nonissue in my opinion and i leave the charge pad at the most convenient location i am likely to use it.  having a built in battery backup means that i spend less time wondering if i need to charge when i jump in the car or worse yet, wondering if the small charge i can get while in transit will get me through until my next charging opportunity.  with the aero i go until i need to charge and then push a button and keep right on going without a second thought!i was

helpful.  ill be picking up a case for my wife for her birthday for her 5s.update 4114i still love this case and have used it as a daily driver minus a week or so since i got it.  my only complaint with extended use is the way the front and back of the case connect is not as secure as i would like.  i work in sales, as such my phone is constantly in and out of my pocket throughout the day as i am out and about, getting callstexts and getting inout of my car.  the small clips that hold the front guard to the back plate are very minor and it doesnt seem to take much to have one side wiggle loose.  if the phone were to take a fall, im not completely convinced that it would stay together.  i love the case for the extra battery it brings to the table, but if it were possible to beef up the case, i would happily trade a little additional bulk in the design for the added security of knowing that the case wouldnt come apart on a whim.",i was provided with a sample unit from unu for review

526,"this is the fourth usb power supply ive been asked to review two different manufacturers and the oxa models are by far the better devices.the power bank measures 4.0625 x 2.375 x .31, and has a manual on  off button, as well as blue led power  charging indicator lamp. the samsung circuitry is designed to prevent overcharging, and the auto off feature should help reduce idle power loss. what is missing from the power bank is a power level indicator. its not a big deal, but it would have been a nice feature.while this power supply seems to live up to its description, it isnt the best fit for all charging applications, and shoppers should make sure they are buying what they actually need before deciding on what to buy. let me explain.this portable power supply, or power bank, puts out 5 volts at 1 amp and has a 3000mah capacity. first let me explain my use of the word seems in the paragraph above this one. because i dont have a proper battery tester the ones that accurately test capacity are in the 300 range, i can only give anecdotal testimony about the power output and capacity of a battery. because i have an extensive collection of devices and a variety of batteries for my devices, i have a pretty good idea what x amount of capacity and y amount of amps output are. my best guess is that this oxa power supply meets or possibly exceeds the claimed power output by a small measure.now, why do i say this power supply isnt ideal for every application? the answer is that many larger and high end devices consume much more energy than what this oxa product can supply. two examples are my samsung galaxy note 2 and my wifes kindle fire. my note 2 ships with a 2 amp charger and even that is barely enough to charge the battery if im using the phone as a gps with the screen on full brightness. this oxa would certainly extend my usage time, but my phone would continue to discharge even while plugged into the charger. i did leave the phone connected to the power supply overnight with the screen off, and it did raise my battery level from 14 to 62 by morning, but my phone has a massive 9300mah extended battery, which explains why the power supply didnt fully charge it.i plugged my ipod touch 4th generation into the oxa power bank with the battery at 12 and my ipod played music for nearly five days before running the power bank and its own internal battery down. the reason for this is that the ipod has a much smaller battery and consumes a fraction of the energy my phone burns through.so before buying this oxa mini power supply, think about if it will do what you need it to. oxa sells a wide array of larger and more expensive power supplies, and of course there are other manufacturers out there as well. this power bank is a nice size to keep with you and will generally provide enough power for most users, but it youre planning on getting many hours of constant use from a tablet, then you might want to go with something larger, like oxas7800mah juice box s1or10000mah juice box s2.after playing with it for a few days, im satisfied that this charger does what it claims, and it is somewhat less expensive 16.99 at time of review than competing models in the same size and power output classes. for me personally, because of my energy hungry devices, i probably would want a more powerful supply. if youre looking to charge an ipod or more energy efficient phone, then this model is definitely one you should consider.i didnt pay for my test sample, but had i bought this for 17 here on amazon, id be very happy with the value i received. all things considered, this little thing definitely deserves five stars.",supply ive been asked to review 
144,"this is the glossy black version of the iflash 3,200mah power bank. i also have and have reviewed the white version. rather than repeat the review, ill summarize the main points this is a nicely made, very slim about 38 inch thick powerbank that works well. what it lacks in terms of charge capacity it makes up for in ease of carrying around.like the white version, the only major issue i have with this is the micro usb cable that is built into the device. while this is a good idea since it makes the power bank easier to use, the cord length is too short for comfortable use about 4 inches long fully extended and it can be a pain to recoil the cord so that it fully retracts into the power bank body. thats the main reason for a loss of one star.however, the black version also has another strike it is a major fingerprint magnet. while im sure the white version attracts as many fingerprints since it also has a glossy finish, you have the benefit of not seeing them. thats not the case with the black version  smudges galore!i wont detract a star because of that since its strictly an aesthetic issue and has nothing to do with performance, but point it out in case youre bugged by easily smudged devices.like the white version this does most things very well, and does so with a very small footprint thats easy to take along. definitely worth considering, and a good value for the price.sample provided for review",sample provided for review

945,this isnt my first backup battery charger but it is quickly becoming one of my favorites. i like that my husband and i can charge our phones with one back up charger at the same time. its also great for charging the kids tablets between one destination and another if need be.you want to give the charger plenty of time to charge up before taking it with you so that you get optimal results. once it is charged though it last for quiet awhile in stationary mode until its needed.the size is decent and the price  as of now is comparable to others one the market. i look forward to taking this with us when we go camping and boating next year. not that i spend that time on my phone but you never know when youll need a life line.ive said it before and ill say it again you cant put a price on peace of mind. sabrent makes being on the go a little bit more care free since we all relay so much on technology these days. i would recommend this product to anyone looking for a backup.i was provided a sample of this product for review all opinions are honest and my own.,provided a sample of this product for review all opinions

758,"this mount comes in three parts. the handle bar strap, hard bumper style case and a clear plastic cover. its like having a rain coat on your phone.the bumper case is a bit awkward to remove the phone once you have the phone in place.i found that the mount attachment could have been designed better. i have another case by this same company and that case has a full 360 rotation. this case requires that you remove the case from the mount turn it and reattach it landscaped or portrait. so you cannot move it on the fly. the bumper case also has an opening for you camera, but it concerns me a bit, because if you ride in the rain, the phone may get wet because the camera opening in the case is not covered. its just open. maybe a thin plastic liner would be good. this case sells for about 50. and there are cases at this same price and even cheaper that might be a better choice if you want to protect your phone against an actual fall off your bike. if you are easy go lucky and just want a simple case that will work in the bike and fit in your pocket. then this is for you. i would call this a minimalist case. some case are tougher and better built but you cant really walk around with a larger bulky case. this is very light weight and slim case. it weighs less then 2 oz.i am a past bike2power customer. this product was provided to me free of charge in exchange for my honest review.", this product was provided to me free of charge in exchange for my honest review.

345,"this review of the unu aero is based on a free sample of the product that was supplied to me by the manufacturer in exchange for my evaluation and review of the product. i also want to mention that i am the owner of a unu dx for an iphone 5 which i purchased from woot, a subsidiary of amazon. a separate review of that product appears elsewhere on amazon.i use my iphone 5 extensively every day and put a large strain on the life of the battery. ive owned it since september of 2012 and i recently had to replace the battery because it had reached a level where it could no longer hold a charge. my usage only increases if im on a plane or away from home for an extended period of time. under the best of circumstances im lucky if i get a  days charge out of my iphone, and usually by late afternoon it hits the 20 mark. thats the reason that i started to check out battery cases for my iphone 5 and originally chose the unu dx. over the last two weeks ive had the opportunity to check out the aero case from unu, and im impressed.the unu aero comes in two pieces. it uses a bumpershaped border to attach the phone to the backplate, which contains the battery and charger. while it is better suited for a semipermanent installation of an iphone, its easy enough to remove the case if necessary. on the other hand, the dx is a split case that allows for somewhat easier installation and removal of the iphone and therefore better suited for occasional use when you know youll be away from a charging source for the day.the aeros nonslip case feels great in my hand and is much easier to grip than the phone itself. i can be on my iphone for a long call and the phone feels comfortable and secure. it also looks like it would offer significant protection against drops and rough usage, although youll forgive me if i didnt test that feature!the edges of the aero case appear to be flush with the front surface of the phone. if you lay the phone face down, the case would allow the glass to touch the surface. this isnt a showstopper for me, but if youre in a business environment where youve gotten into the habit of putting your phone face down for privacy, be aware that the aeros case wont elevate the phone so as not to touch the surface and potentially creating the possibility of scratching the screen.the aeros real claim to fame is the simplicity of charging the phone and the battery case. it has a flat, unobtrusive dock where you lay the battery case and it immediately starts charging! the phone comes on briefly to verify it, just as if youd plugged it into a charging unit directly. the iphone charges first, then the case. if both are fully drained you can expect about 45 hours for a full charge. if only the phone is discharged, figure about 23 hours. you can orient the aero in any direction on the dock and it will still charge as long as the two nodes on the back of the back of the battery case touch the surface.the big differentiator for the aero is its simplicity in charging both the battery case and the phone. i cant imagine it being any easier. i dont like to fuss with the micro usb cable on the unu dx, trying to figure out which side is up or down, especially in dim light. unfortunately neither the aero or dx can be charged using a lightning connector. with the aeros charging dock, once its set up, there are no cords to fuss with. find a convenient place for the dock, then connect the micro usb plug to it, plug the large usb plug into any appropriate power source, and theres never any need to fool with the cables again. i have mine connected to an ihome radio on my bed stand that has a rear usb port. i drop it on the dock before i go to bed and grab it the next morning, with the phone and battery case fully charged. seriously effortless.using the aero away from home to charge the iphone battery is straightforward. there is a button on the lower back of the case. hold it in for a few seconds and youll see the battery indicator on your iphone turn green, indicating that the case is charging the phone, exactly as if youd connected it directly to a charger. and you can continue to use the phone while its charging! let the phone charge as it would normally and then turn off the battery case by holding down the button on the rear of aero case..there are 4 leds on the back of the aero, below the power button, that indicate how much of a charge is left on the battery case. my experience is that if you engage charging when the 20 power warning is displayed on the phone, the aero will still have power left after the phone reaches 100. thats a good thing since there are days when ive had to use that last remaining power to get me through the day before i get back to my hotel room.the aero is slightly lighter than the dx, weighing in at 2.5 ounces versus the dx at 2.9 making it less obtrusive in your pocket. the aeros battery is 2000 mah versus 2300 for the dx. both, however, are more than sufficient to fully charge an iphone from 0 power. trust me about this, ive been there!!if you plan to travel with the aero, simply unplug the large usb side of the docks cable from the power source, throw the dock in your suitcase with the other end of the cable attached, and youre ready to plug it in to a power source when you reach your destination. you can use either the white iphone usb charging cube, a usb power source offered in many hotels, or the usb port of your computer.one note regarding the headphone jack. both the dx and aero have a cord that comes with the case that allows you to access the headphone jack. unfortunately, the headphone jack is recessed deeply in the case so that it requires an adapter which is included with the phone. i use bluetooth earbuds so this isnt a problem for me. if, however, youre using wired headphones or earbuds, youll need to keep this small cord handy in your pocket or purse, or leave it attached to your earbuds or headphone cord. its secure enough attached to that cord so that you wont lose it.the bottom line is that the aero is a great battery case that is effortless to charge. for someone who has the need to juiceup their phone daily, the aero is a great choice and as easy as can be to recharge. for those who only need extra phone power occasionally, the dx would be my choice. either way these are both topnotch products from unu.",this review of the unu aero is based on a free sample of the product that was supplied to me by the manufacturer in exchange for my evaluation and review of the product.
1009,"this sabrent hub is tiny.  four ports in something that looks like i broke off a piece of kit kat.  i cant believe they can shrink it that small.its got a short cord and is bus powered.  that means it uses the power on the usb port.  if you have devices that draw a lot of power, it might overwhelm the hub.  i have a card reader, bluetooth dongle, microphone, and fingerprint reader attached to it right now and it handles those all at once just fine.  the only thing that it doesnt play nice with is my logitech universal receiver.  that thing is very finicky, so im not surprised.i love the portability factor.  it doesnt take up any space and hardly weighs a thing.  that makes it ideal for laptops and netbooks.  im using it right now for my windows 7 pc, but for desktops, i prefer something with a longer cord.this product was provided for review by sabrent.",provided for review 
959,"this sabrent usb turbo charging adapter for powered usb ports is an inexpensive little device, but its hard to tell how useful it really is.  i was interested because its supposed to allow you to use a standard usb port to charge a tablet pc or ipad.  i tried the adapter with a usb port on a belkin surge protector seebelkin surge protector that would not charge my ipad2, and it did in fact boost the ports power so that the ipad2 began charging.however, the device didnt work for charging an ipad 2 from a powered belkin 4port usb 3.0 hub seebelkin superspeed usb hub.  the failure was apparently the hubs fault, because plugging the ipad2 into the hub by itself  without the sabrent adapter caused my win7 system to produce a power surge warning saying that the devices power request exceeded the ports capability.  adding the sabrent adapter didnt change anythingthe same power surge warning came up.  so it would appear that this adapter will not necessarily work with every single powered usb port.for me, its easier to charge ipads and tablets using dedicated 1a ports as found on newer charging stations, e.g.,chil powershare reactor charging station than to use an adapter to try to speed up charging.  still, this little adapter only 134 long is very portable, and might be just the ticket for a travelers needs.  because its inexpensive about 6 and performs somewhat as advertised, i rate it at 3 stars its okay on the official amazon scale.disclaimer note  this review is based on a product supplied to me free of charge for review purposes.  i have no financial interest or business relationship with the manufacturer or seller, and this review represents my independent opinion of the product.",disclaimer note  this review is based on a product supplied to me free of charge for review purposes.

967,"this solves a problem that i wasnt trying to fix as i didnt think there was a solution to it. the sabrent usb turbo charging adapter allows me to charge my ipad on a normal usb port on my computer, where normally id only get the not charging message because theres not enough power going to the usb port.my normal routine is that i can charge my iphone in a regular usb port on my computer, but i have to use a power plug for my ipad charging unless i want to let it sit connected for a day or two. this device promised to allow me to charge the ipad via the usb port, so i did a timed test. my ipad was at 75 at 600 am this morning when i plugged it in with the adapter. it recognized the power source and was up to 85 an hour later. for a comparison, i then unplugged the adapter and attempted to charge the ipad for another hour from the usb port. i got the not charging message, and after an hour i had only gone from 85 to 87. granted, its not as fast as a power plug, but its the difference between being able to fully charge the ipad via usb in 10 hours instead of 50.one thing to keep in mind, however... when using this adapter, it will only provide power to the ipad. it will not sync data like it would with a normal connection. in my opinion, this is so easy and quick to plug in, i could run a quick sync and then switch over to using this adapter. it wouldnt be that big of an issue for me.this will be sitting on top of my computer next to the usb plug for those times when i want to do a quick topoff of my ipad and dont want to find a power plug or unplug another cord thats already there.disclosureobtained from manufacturerpayment free","provide power to the ipad. it will not sync data like it would with a normal connection. in my opinion,"

8,"this sterling silver chain is so soft and smooth it feels like silk thread on my skin.  i have the 24 chain so that is long enough to slip over my head without having to unfasten the lobster clasp every time i want to wear it.  i tried the necklace with a small pendant i already own, but the chain is so delicate that the weight of the pendant pulled it out of the soft drape style i preferred.  it is also so lightweight that i forgot to take it off and slept with it on without experiencing any discomfort at all.  i dont know that i will want to do that on a regular basis, but it is still nice to know.the necklace arrived in a lovely silver colored box which would only need the addition of a ribbon to turn it into a nice gift.  not having to wrap a box is a definite plus from my standpoint.  because this necklace is such a reasonable price, i think combining several different lengths would make a very dramatic statement.  i can say the 24 length looked very good against a black mockturtleneck sweater.i received this item at no charge from newport blvd.  the opinions expressed are my own.",i received this item at no charge from newport blvd.

142,"ultra slim 3200mah external battery pack looks very slick, it is quite thin. one unique feature of this external power pack is that it has a micro usb cable built into the side of the unit see attached photo collage. it pops out of the side on a coiled cable, so if your mobile device takes a micro usb connector you dont need to carry any extra cables. this builtin cable delivers very rapid charging see test results below. the power pack also has a port which allows you to connect other connectors, so it works with devices that have proprietary connectors as well.i tested ultra slim 3200mah external battery pack with galaxy nexus phone running ics 4.0.4, samsung galaxy 7.7 tablet running ics 4.0.4 and ipad mini.i received this power bank from the manufacture for an honest review be it positive or negative. top reviewers are often asked to review new battery packs and one of the benefits of being asked to test different power banks is that it gives me an opportunity to compare them to each other using the same charging test, so i can compare them using apples to apples comparison. this set of tests allows me to provide unbiased results as the numbers speak for the performance of each unit.i received two identical units black and white, having two of them allows me to test for consistency in manufacturing. ideally i want to see the same performance numbers for both units, and this was the case with the two ultra slim power packs .my methodology is to charge each mobile device on each port of the unit for 10 minutes and measuring how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period. in addition i tested charging two mobile devices at the same time. each line in the table below represents a separate 10 minute test. i use battery app by elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. ac status means the charging is at full charging rate. usb status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. discharging status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not recharge.10152 general featuresultra slim 3200mah external battery weighs 3.2 oz. its size is 2.25 x4.25  x 0.375. the pack has one usb output port and one builtin micro usb cable.in addition to the builtin micro usb cable ultra slim comes with a charging cable and two tips  micro usb and ipad. it did not have tips for samsung galaxy tab or lightening connector for ipad mini and i used my own charging cables during the tests. i am attaching a photo of the ultra slim 3200mah during one of the test next to my tablet for size reference. you can find this photo by following customer photos link under the main photo in this listing.ultra slim 3200mah looks very slick it is thin, has a nice finish, and in general has a look and shape of a smart phone. it shows the charge level by displaying 25, 50, 75, 100 on panel. when it is charging, however, this indicator gets turned off. but the charging continued even when the lights were off. this is a little different from how other external power pack indicators work they stay on when you are charging,so i wanted to mention it. in addition to the charging capabilities, ultra slim has a builtin flashlight.10152 test results10004 galaxy nexus phonewhite unit ac  6 change in charge in 10 minutes builtin mciro usb charging cableblack unit ac  6 change in charge in 10 minutes builtin mciro usb charging cablewhite unit ac  2 change in charge in 10 minutes separate charging cableblack unit ac  2 change in charge in 10 minutes separate charging cable10004 samsung galaxy 7.7 tabletwhite unit ac  1 change in charge in 10 minutes separate charging cableblack unit ac  1 change in charge in 10 minutes separate charging cable10004 ipad mini tabletwhite unit ac  1 change in charge in 10 minutes separate charging cableblack unit ac  1 change in charge in 10 minutes separate charging cable10152 key finding10004 this power pack has great performance with builtin micro usb cable.10004 using your own charging cables the power pack works with both galaxy 7.7 tablet and ipad mini but performance is on the slow side.10004 i observed the same performance for both the black and white model, which is good and reflects consistency in the manufacturing process.i highly recommend this power pack to people who can take advantage of the builtin micro usb cable.note the photo collage referenced in the review can be located by following customer photos link under the main photo.ali julia review",ali julia review

257,"unlike other more technical reviewers, i do not have the capability to test the units input and output levels, but have provided a description of exactly what we experiencedpackaging was simple  a formfitting ziploc bag with the bubblewrapped unit inside, and it was easy to open. the battery pack is of very convenient size 4.5 inches long x 2.5 inches wide x .25 inches thick and weighs just 3 ounces and does resemble a slimline smartphone. to see what it looks like, navigate to the bottom of the items sales page and look for the pictures i uploaded. these pictures are now found on that first page, to the right of where the most helpful reviews start.the user manual we received really was not a user manual at all... it is a disclaimerfilled warranty summary with a request for a product review inside, but without any informative user instruction. i was not 100 sure what to do, so i plugged the devices usb into my samsung phones wall outlet adapter output 5v 0.7a and waited to see what would happen.three little blue lights started blinking  and, about 2 hours later, they all stopped blinking and stayed fully on so i assumed this meant that the battery was fully charged. the lack of user instruction is the reason for the four start rating the back of the phone does say that instructions are available on the company website, but accessing the internet was not convenient at the time.when hooked up to a fully drained samsung reality, the phone jumped to life. the reality fully charged after about 1 hour and 45 minutes on the battery pack, and two of the battery packs blue lights remained lit afterwards suggesting the device still has more than 50 of its charging power left.the phone did get fairly warm during the charging process, but no warmer than if put on its own charger in a fully depleted condition. the phone was charged and fully functional, and the battery pack did not heat up at all.for fourteen bucks, whats not to like? this unit could come in handy someday and is very affordable, very portable, and did the job as described by the manufacturer.while i received a gratis sample of this item review, this is my objective evaluation.  if you are looking for such a battery pack, and if your budget is like mine, id recommend it.","while i received a gratis sample of this item review, this is my objective evaluation."

295,"unu enerpak flexi portable usb battery packi received the unu enerpak flexi battery pack as a free sample for review and to share my experience with the product. i was interested in the product for its size and convenience. i was not disappointed.  the enerpak flexi has a small form factor and is nicely lightweight. i have a fouryearold battery pack from another maker, and it is almost like carrying a brick. the enerpak also performed very well.  after using and testing it for about two months, i was very pleased with the performance and recharge times. my iphone 5 went from 20 to 80 in less than an hour. after using the iphone 5 down to under 10 while at the airport, the enerpak had the phone back up to 100 in just over an hour, even though the phone was still being used. charging the enerpak unit was no problem.  simply plug it into the usb port in the laptop and you8217re back up and running with the full four lights indicating a full power.since my job dictates extensive use of the phone, whenever i am out of the office, i can run down the batteries of my iphone and ipad with astonishing speed.  a battery backup is essential for me. the enerpak will now be my battery back up of choice.as for the cons, the directions are pretty sparse, but then again, the unit is essentially selfexplanatory. the unit does charge iphones and ipads with no problem, but a separate 8211and not included cable is needed.  i noted some of the pictures on the unu box showed the purple integrated charging cable connected directly to an iphone.  since one end of the cable is usb and the other end is microusb, a direct connection via the charging cable is simply not possible.overall though, the unu enerpak flexi is a great product and well worth the price.",unu enerpak flexi portable usb battery packi received the unu enerpak flexi battery pack as a free sample for review and to share my experience with the product.
474,"unu provided a free sample for review.i love my iphone 5s. i really do. the only thing that bugs me about it is the battery life. sure, if you are really careful and turn down your screen brightness, shut off bluetooth and wifi, and dont use your phone too much, you can probably get through an average day. who wants to do that? i want to actual use my phone, which forces me to have extra chargers wherever i go.  i have tried a few different charger cases, but the size of the cases really bothered me. whats the point of having a nice slim phone if youre going to use it inside a brick? the best of the lot was unus former flagship model, the power dx. it worked well, but it has a weird protruding portion on top and overall it was still a bit too big for me.the new unu aero series case to the rescue. i ordered the white version. it has an attractive gloss think of a storm trooper from star wars, but surprisingly enough it doesnt seem to show fingerprints. as far as size goes, it is ever so slightly thicker at its thickest point than a lifeproof case. this is due to the curved back design of the case so it actually is thinner than a lifeproof case on the sides. im happy with the size.a novel feature of the case is that it comes with a wireless charging mat. the case itself has 2 metal prongs that are flush with the case. when you place it on the charging mat, the battery case and your phone will be recharged. it works well. the battery case and charging mat come with a very short micro usb cord, so unless you are going to charge this right next to your computer, youre going to need a bigger boat longer cable. i place to charging mat next to my bed and plug it into a usb wall charger. you can also plug the micro usb cord into the battery case itself.the case works well. when you notice that your iphone battery is getting low, you just push the small button on the back and bam, the phone is charging. tiny led blue lights illuminate to let you know battery is in charging mode.the case itself seems pretty durable, i havent noticed any scratches yet! it seems to offer decent protection for the phone. its not an otterbox, but i think the case would protect the phone from a fall. the sides of the case extend out far enough so the screen is held above the table when put face down.all in all, im pretty darn happy with the case. i use the phone all day long, dont worry about having a charger nearby. when i go to bed, i place the phone on the charging mat and the phone is ready to go and fully charged when i get up in the morning.",unu provided a free sample for review.
285,"unu sent me a sample enerpak back in november, so i have had a chance to put it through it paces over the holidays.this is a very handy and useful addition to any power users bag. with 4400 mah of backup power you can recharge just about any battery powered portable device you have with you. the handy attached charging cable is great for topping off your enerpak before tossing it into your backpack. the attached cable is there to charge the enerpak and is not there to charge your iphone or ipad though it will work for many other brands of tablets  phones. but i always have an apple cable in my bag, so it isnt a big deal for me. speaking of bags, this is not something to carry in your pocket, it is bigger about the size and weight of a hockey puck and more bulky than the unu echopak, but also more powerful 4400mah vs 2500mah.i would definately buy one for other members of my family.","unu sent me a sample enerpak back in november, so i have had a chance to put it through it paces over the holidays."
476,"unu sent me one of their new wireless chargers to try out and it works. everything it claims to do it does, but it wasnt anything special to me and i felt like there were some easily avoidable oversights but well get to those in due time.lets start with the good. the case is nice. i like the matte black finish and the soft sort of texture it has. its reasonably grippy and doesnt collect finger prints.the case is thinner than i had expected given that it has a battery in it, but it is about a centimeter longer than the phone itself. since the iphone 5s is quite long and thin already this exsentuates it and makes it feel a little akward in my hand maybe its something i would get used to with time but for now its a bit off. the length also causes a problem with the headphone jack not accepting wide headphone plugs. the manufacturer fixes this by throwing in a cheap extension wire, but for the price i feel like they should have built the extension into the case. i dont want to carry an extra wire.the battery feature works well. it doesnt turn on unless you tell it to which i didnt realize at first and my phone was near dead 1 when i finally activated the battery by holding the button on the case. the battery isnt huge. it charged the phone to roughly 80 from dead which got me through the day, but might not be enough for a true power user yay puns and definitely wont let you go days without the charger.the charging pad is small maybe too small. i found it to be light enough that the kinked corder could flip it over when the phone wasnt on it. its an interesting design, but when it comes down to it, its really an extension cord more than it is a wireless charger. the contacts on the back of the case sit up against the metal plate to allow the phone to charge. the whole thing works and seems relatively safe. i licked both contacts of the plate ... you know... for science and didnt die or really even get much of a shock, but it wasnt the fancy induction style charging you see in electric toothbrushes.lastly, while my phone didnt give the charging not supported with this accessory message that is common with third party unbranded chargers, i didnt see the made for iphone logo on any of the packaging which makes me a bit wary. the lightning connector, apple can block chargers from charging your device if the manufacturer hasnt paid a royalty. again i have had no issue with this to date and ill update if i run into any issues with this.if all you want is a no frills wireless chargerbattery combo i dont want to dissuade you from this one, but its got its quirks and sits at 3 stars in my book",unu sent me one of their new wireless chargers to try out and it works

320,"upon first impression of this battery pack, it is a lot larger than the other one i have about the size of my palm and thought i wouldnt want to carry that around instead of my 8220stick8221 charger. it was about half way charged when i received it, so it didnt take too much longer to fully charge.  the instructions are pretty basic, but there is a description to let you know when the charge is complete. it comes with a wraparound usbmicro usb to use for a majority of gadgets. i thought the ubs plugs are really hard to pull out of the unit, especially when the cord is wrapped around it. my fingers have slipped off a few times trying to unplug it, but i8217m hoping it is just because it8217s new. since the cord is molded to form around the pack a plus, it does make charging an item a bit awkward for placement ie charging a phone to have it facing up. ok, now to the part that matters. i used this to charge up a gopro camera and found it did a fairly decent job. it was able to charge the camera to about 80 within an hour or so. it8217s a great product to have on hand for a quick power boost for your device, since the cord is easily stored on the unit. it8217s great to throw into a large bag, but would be a bit awkward in a small bag or purse.i received this item for free from the company to give an unbiased review of my experience.",i received this item for free from the company to give an unbiased review of my experience.

221,"we spent the day at disneyland using our phones to take pictures of our granddaughter. the cell phone needed a boost and this auxiliary power did the trick. we are very happy with this tool and happy to have it around in a pinch. ive found that it can take a couple hours to fully charge, but it can charge up my iphone 4s pretty quick.here are the specifics. there is a micro usb connector used for input. on the input side its rated at 1.5a a 1.5a charger will charge it quickest. theres a full usb connector used for output. on the output side its rated at 2.1a. there are 3 leds internal to the case that light through the colored back cover right next to the output usb slot. when all 3 are lit, its fully charged. each blinks in sequence as charging, representing a third charged each. very simple and requires no buttons or user actions to operate. the lights operate in reverse to show remaining capacity as you use it to charge your devices.to test the capacity, i ran my iphone 4s down to 33. i then plugged my iphone 4s into the 5 star america battery to charge it back up. it took about 35 minutes to get my phone back up to 67, and it took about 90 minutes to get back up to 95. i was able to use the backup battery to do this twice with my iphone when i started with a fully charged backup. this is a great option, as i often drain my iphone when i use it in tethered mode to get my laptop online and sendreceive some files, sync mail and so forth. tethering is one way to quickly drain my battery and having a backup power source really helps.as for using the backup battery, its convenient that it has a full usb port since i can use it to charge any device that can take power from a usb port. ive tested with an iphone 4s, and a samsung galaxy tab3. the battery looks like a phone due to the black plastic front and its iphone shape.4 stars, i am happy with this light, slim, easy to pocket and use battery.  depending on your needs, you might consider a larger capacity if you are charging tablets for example, but for a quick boost in a small package this is a nice option.  i was provided a sample for evaluation",  i was provided a sample for evaluation

514,"when i first received these from sharkk for testing, the first thing i noticed was the tangle free cord on the headphones. this told me that i was going to be using a product where quality and customer are put first.the packaging requires scissors to open, but once the plastic is off, the rest goes easy. the instruction manual definitely necessary to pair device is inside of a rectangular box within the packaging.at first, the headphones felt pretty bulky, but upon putting them in my ear, they fit quite nicely, and do not pop out easily. another thing about my first impression was that they felt really well built and very solid.the instruction manual was a bit wordy, but easy to follow. i was able to pair the headphones with my phone in under 3 minutes the first time. the headphones are very user friendly, with the power button, and the led indicator light easily located.when compared to brand name wired headphones of near the same price, i noticed that these wireless headphones sounded better all around, which is very impressive. bass is also very good at hitting the lows without sounding scratchy. the bass is only really heard if you either turn the volume up high, or turn the bass up individually using your phone or other device.the trick to making these stay secure in your ear is to make sure you put the right in the right ear, and the left in the left ear. no matter how much headbanging you do, they will still stay secure.all in all, these headphones are worth every penny. if you are in the market for affordable wireless headphones, this should be your first choice.","when i first received these from sharkk for testing, the first thing i noticed was the tangle free cord on the headphones."
281,"when i first received this, i loved the look of it and loved that it was matte which means that it is non slip which is great! but then i found that it is a fingerprint magnet which somewhat sucks but can be cleaned. first impression of the box, i noticed that on the back, that the cable was connected directly to an iphone 5s and it says it is a battery pack for iphones ipods etc, so i thought the cable that is included is a cable which is a lightning cable according to the image, but then i looked at it again and found out that the cable is hooked up to a unu case which has microusb. deceptive! i opened the item and found that the instructions were too basic, some things i wanted to know were not on there, like how to take the cable apart.i then opened the battery and looked at it and boy is it nice! the look and design are brilliant! the cable within the battery pack is genius! only thing is that the cable is too short! i will explain further. the battery pad not heavy and basically gives a good charge, at a medium rate, not fast not too slow, and it does not get too hot which charging or discharging which is good.i will list the cons of this battery pack as it is good otherwise.first of all, the power led indication light is very confusing, in the manual it states there are several modes which light up different amount of lights to show how much battery is left, but this is not the case as for me, no matter what i see 3 lights on. basically the illuminated ring which shows the battery percentage either doesnt work in my particular device or i have no clue how to read it at all.secondly, if instead of coming with a microusb cable, it came with a lighting cable it would great, as i am pretty sure the lightning cable would fit in the spot where the hole is currently right now.the device is some what thick for the capacity. i have seen higher capacity batteries much thinner than this. i also had no clue of how to charge this as it didnt tell me.the cable is too short, it may be good for compact charging on the go, but it isnt good for home use or using a wall charger with it.since this item didnt come with a wall charger, i had to use mynew trent nt90c 10w 5v2a dual usb ports highspeed ac wall charger for smartphones, 5v tablets and more.charger which i have also reviewed. the problem with the short cord is that it hangs on the wall outlet causing a hazard. it would be nice if they had made it so that the cord was a bit longer. i can imagine that instead of the two bumps for the cords being on the two sides, that there are bumps on all four sides which enables for a longer cord.finally, i was confused with the in and out on the bottom and all the unlabeled ports on the bottom.in the end, this is over all a great design and idea. the only thing is that the cord is too short and the battery indicator is wonky. the reason why i would rate this a 3.5 stars is that it comes with a short microusb port, i mean if they could have made it come with a lightning connector option along with the microusb option it would be very good as some people have different devices. otherwise if it had come with a lightning cable, i would have rated 4.5 stars, losing half a star because of the short cord, confusing indicator and being a bit too thick along with no specification of what charger to use. point is make a lightning cable!!!please note that i was provided a review unit by unu and i was not required to write a positive review. all the contents stated above are my own opinion.",please note that i was provided a review unit by unu and i was not required to write a positive review. all the contents stated above are my own opinion.

99,"when i was offered the ihangy for review, i told ontrion i wasnt keen on having my iphone hanging around my neck.  they sent it anyway.  gutsy move.  i thought, heres a company that believes in its product.  so, ive been using it on my daily walks.i was a little selfconscious, at first, but now i dont feel as ridiculous as i imagined.  the phone attaches via the charging port, but its secure.  i havent had any accidental releases that i imagined would happen.  in fact, sometimes i forget its not a charging cord and just try to yank it out.  it doesnt come off unless i simultaneously squeeze the release buttons on the side.the attached ear buds are metal, which means i can wipe them off with alcohol.  they dont slip out, but i get a better fit with other types of ear buds.  these dont block ambient noise, if i keep the volume down.  i like that, since im walking and i want to hear the car coming before it hits me.the ear buds connect via auxiliary port, so i dont have to bother with bluetooth.  i get crisp and clear music in stereo with my iphone 4s.  it lacks a little in warmth but its not bad at all.  the average listener would not find have any issues with it.although im still not a fan of wearing my phone on a lanyard, i like the ihangy more than i thought i would.  it allows me quick access to the phone and a great thing to have when i dont have pockets.  i wouldnt recommend it for the gym or jogging, since the phone swings around and is likely to be bumped or get in the way.  its best used for walking.if you want to wear your phone, this works quite well.  the mount is secure and the sound quality good.  its a convenient way to keep a phone handy without a wallet.this product was provided for review by ontrion.",this product was provided for review by ontrion.
89,"when i was offered the music necklace for free in return for a review, i was psyched to more easily listen to my ipod during exercise.all in all, it is a great idea. for the most part, and i am betting, for most people, this is the solution to carry an iphone or ipod handsfree and have the convenience to take  make calls and  or listen to music.the ihangy necklace strap adjuster works to wear a device high on the chest or lower towards the abs or anywhere in between. it is very easy to adjust to any individual preferred length. the necklace locks to the device by the port used for charging. it felt really secure and i completely trust the necklaces ability to hold my device.the issue i had was with the the built in headphones. it will not be the same for everyone, i am sure, but the earbuds would not stay in when i was moving at more than a walking pace. after breaking into a jog, at least one would pop out.the idea of the headphones is great and i would certainly try this product again if it was modified. perhaps make it so that i could incorporate my own earbuds into the design? or, provide different sizes of earbuds? in any case, i would really love to use this product as intended because i think the concept is solid.",when i was offered the music necklace for free in return for a review
582,"when it comes to external batteries, the greater the capacity the better and this 15,000mah battery is the best ive come across yet.ive test several 10,000mah batteries including products from other companies and this 15,000mah has 50 more capacity but is only 1520 bigger and only about 20 more expensive.comments i really like the lcd readout that shows the remaining charge. all other brands ive used use led lights to show remaining charge, but this one has an actual readout. the 50 extra capacity really makes a difference in the amount of devices you can charge and it seems to charge faster. comes with a carrying pouch and charging cable with miniusb, microusb and apple 30 pin interchangeable heads. 2.1a and 1a outputs plus a small flashlight. this company has excellent and responsive customer service.external batteries are getting better all the time and this latest model i have received is the best ive seen yet. its the most powerful and relatively inexpensive. if you plan to get a high capacity external battery, id recommend this one. sample was provided for review purposes.","received is the best ive seen yet. its the most powerful and relatively inexpensive. if you plan to get a high capacity external battery, id recommend this one. sample was provided for review "
451,"when looking for a battery case there are a few very important qualities we are all looking for.  give me the slimmest case with the most capacity and make it all easy.  the unu aero delivers on all fronts.  this has a 2000 mah battery which is much more than the mophie helium and air and much sleeker than the plus.  in addition the design allows the entire back to be battery with the front of the case easily snapping on.  this is a front back split instead of a top and bottom.  like this much better, feels like the case is one piece and is also easy to assemble and take apart.  the addition of the wireless charging i thought was just a gimmick, love this too.  keep the charging plate next to my bed and at the end of the day just place the case on the pad and it is charging.  if i need to check something on my phone there is no cord to unplug and plug back in after.  i have tried all the charging cases on the market and this is my favorite by far.  unu sent me this one as a free sample for review.  liked it so much i purchased 3 of them for the rest of my family.",  unu sent me this one as a free sample for review.
1007,"when my review sample arrived i was surprised by the size  it looks more like a multiport usb stick with a pigtail than a hub. but a hub it is.dimensions of the body are about 3 78 inches long by slightly over a half inch thick. it takes up very little space for road warriors and travelers, and if you are using a micro otg connector for your phone or tablet like this one micro usb otg host cable to usb 2.0 adapter this hib is the perfect way to expand it.i was concerned that this would not really support four devices simultaneously so i plugged it into my thinkpad t61 running windows xp. i populated the four ports with a mouse, a keyboard, my digital camera and my galaxy note 3 phone. i was especially eager to see if the phone balked because its finicky about what gets plugged into it when it comes to synching and transferring. no problem with any of the devices in fact i am writing this review using the external keyboard. i was able to read the cameras memory card with windows explorer while transferring a dummy file from my phone.  i did not test any of the claimed transfer speeds.bottom line this is small, convenient and works on my old laptop without a hitch. it may be only usb 2.0, but its plenty fast for my needs. especially since the only 3.0 device i own is my phone and i rarely connect it to anything but my 2.0 laptop. for what it is i rated it five stars.",when my review sample arrived
